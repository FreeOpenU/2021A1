related to tourism), which have played, and are playing, and will continue to play very significant roles in the social, political and economic and tourism development of Nigeria.
The three modes are rail, road and airline, all of which require conscious policies, heavy capital investment, and continuous maintenance organisations to bring into existence their networks, terminals and rolling stocks, and to keep these and other supporting industries, functioning effectively to the satisfaction of more than 95% of the transport needs of this country.
Each of these modes will be discussed briefly in each of the three sections into which this unit has been divided, with specific reference to their historical development impact on the Nigerian economy, and the prospects and programmes of the Nigerian govenunents for their further development.
2.0 OBJECTIVES A tourist can travel by a variety of means.
Hence it is necessary for both the tourist as well as the tourism professional to familiarise themselves with the various modes of transport.
After reading this unit, you should be able to:  Learn the stages of development of various modes of transport;  Identify the different modes of transport  Appreciate the importance of transport in the promotion of tourism, and  Understand the need for a national transport policy.
3.1 RAUL TRANSPORT HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT The advent of the railway marked the beginning of the modem system of wheeled transportation in Nigeria.
Unlike in European countries, Nigeria jumped the chariot stage by changing from human porterage on rail transport in the long-distance movement of people and commodities across the land.
The railway was begun in 1898 with the Lagos-Ibadan line, which was completed in 1901 and later extended to Jebba in 1909.
With the opening of the Jebba Bridge, the Lagos - Jebba line was linlced in 1915 with the Kano-Baro line which had earlier been completed in 1911.
East of the River Niger, another line had begun from Port Harcourt, reaching Enugu in 1916 and was later extended to Jos and Kaduna, thus linldng the Western and Eastem lines.
Jos was linked with Zaria in 1912 by a narrow-guage line, 2  designed for the evacuation of tin from the Jos Plateau.
This narrow guage line.... called the Bauchi Light Railway was closed in 1957.
Apart from the two main lines, branch lines were also built from Zaria to Kaura Namoda, Kano to Nguru and Ifo to Adogo.
The conception and development of the Nigeria Railway were motivated by strategic as well as commercial reasons.
It was the hope of the planners that the extension of the railway to northern Nigeria would facilitate the economic development of the territory and the evacuation of its agricultural exports, namely cotton, groundnuts, shear-nuts, hides and skins (Tamuno, 1964).
In 1953, a World Bank Mission visited Nigeria.
and recommended an extension of the railways or the construction of a heavy traffic highway if Nigeria was to meet an anticipated expansion of agricultural production in the northeastern part of the country.
.
The mission served that the choice between roads or rail transport for the new area must be based on the total cost of either mode to the community and on the possibility of making the users of the facility share the cost.
Stressing the need for a decision to take into account the traffic potential of the developing northeast, the mission concluded that the railway alternative was likely to prove more advantageous in the end.
The government opted for the railway, which was begun in 1958.
In 1962 the first section of this 644-kilometre Bornu Extension was completed with the opening of the Kuru-Gombe line, while the remaining section was opened in 1964, with the additional in 1966 of a 9.6 - kilometre branch line from Alesa Eleme oil Refinery of Eleleanwa in the Port Harcourt to Enugu railway connecting the two principal seaports, Lagos and Port Harcourt, with the major urban centres in the interior.
CHARACTERISTICS AND ORGANISATION The Nigerian Railways are wholly owned by the Federal Government.
Starting as a government department in 1898, the railways became a statutory body in 1955 when the Nigerian Railway Corporation assumed full responsibility for managing and operating the railway systems as a commercial under-taking, although the Federal Government still retains general powers of control over its policies and rates.
By linking the major producing and heavily populated parts of the country with one another and with two premier sea ports, the Nigerian Railways provide opportunities for long-haul bulk traffic between the northern and southern parts of the country.
However, the axle load permissible on the rail system is limited by several stretches of light-weight rail, while operating tpeeds are restricted by long distances of curved track and steep g r a d i e n t s ( F e d .
R e p u b l i c o f N i g e r i a , 1 9 7 5 ) .

3  In tenns of rolling stock, the Nigerian Railway Corporation owns the entire fleet of locomotives, goods wagons and passenger coaches in use in the economy.
Its stock of locomotives has increased from 273 mainline and shunting locomotives in 1995 to 353 in 1974.
As a result of vigorous dieselization programme, the number of steam locomotives has been reduced from 273 in 1995 to 176 in 1974 while the diesel locomotives have increased from zero in 1955 to 177 in 1974 the total stock of goods used for revenue traffic had exceeded 6000 by 1975 while passenger coaches used for scheduled trains were expected to be over 400 by 1975 (Fed.
Rep. of Nigeria, 1975).
In terms of the actual number of locomotive engines in use, the position calls for improvement.
Both the steam and diesel engines have a depressing record of breakdown which seriously affects the availability rates were only 18% for steam and 54% for diesel engines, the principal reason being the high incidence of defects and the large proportion of engines under or waiting repairs in the maintenance department.
With growing dieselization, the Corporation should be able to take advantage of the lower running cost and greater kilometerage of the diesel engine.
Either the diesel engines having an average cost per engine-kilometre of about one-fourth those of steam (since 1967) there is no reascni why the steam engines cannot be phased out completely to enhance the overall efficiency of the system.
TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND TRENDS Federal govemment investments in the Nigerian Railways have been increasing steadily, especially siuce independence.
During the 1962-68 plan, a total of N43.3 million was invested in the railWays, while the 1970-74 plan witnessed an investment of N118 million out of an allocation of N81 million made to them.
Unfortunately for the railways, there has been a growing decline in its performance osler the years with attendant operating deficits in its accounts.
The corporation'''s freight ' lifting have steadily declined from 3,051,000 tonnes in 1961 - 62 to 1,451,000 tonnes in 1971.- 72 before picking up to 2,010,000 tonnes in 1973 - 74.
Similarly, the number of passengers has shown a downward trend from 12 million in 1962-63 to 4,670,000 in 1973/74.
2 ;2 Three main reasons can be adduced for this decline in the performance of the Railway Corporation.
In the first place, as the nation's road rietwork improves, bigger, faster and more comfortable trucics and passenger buses capture mote freight and passengers from the railways, especially in the areas oflight divisible goods for which the railways, has no inherent advantages over Mad transport.
Secondly, there has been a steady decline in the production and, therefore, the exportation of those traditional txport crops 4  (particularly groundnuts, cotton and hides and skins), which used to form a significant proportion of the export freight moved by railways.
This has largely been due to increasing domestic processing and absorption of these crops by local industries.
The third and perhaps the most significant reason has been the deterioration of the railways goeds transport services.
While the fi?st twO factors are palm produce, kola- nuts, livestock, cement, coal, numerous farms produce and, since 1971, petroleum products moved in bilk-tank wagons between the two port cities (Lagos and Port Harcourt) and the major inland depots like Kano, Kaduna, Zaria, Jos and Maiduguri.
The overall savings in road traffic accident reduction and lower transfer costs achieVed by not using the next available mode, that is, road transport, appears very considerable, though difficult to quantify.
With the reduction in the exportation of groundnuts and cotton largely due to decline in produCtion and increased processing by local industries, the share of expat trade in the railway traffic had dropped from a peak of 53% in 1968/69 to 13% in 1973/74.
With increasing competition from road haulers, this trend has enabled the railways to carry more local products on its internal traffic especially since 1971.
This trend would, however, seem to augur well of the attainment of a nationally integrated economy, in the sense that most of the products being transported internally serve a vital role by complementing the nutritional and industrial needs of the different ecological zones of the country.
PROSPECTS The Federal Government has correctly diagnosed the problems of the Nigerian Railways (already discussed above), and is prepared to effect a drastic modernization of the systern.
To this end, a total sum of N986 million had been allocated to the railways during the current plan period.
Out ofthis amount, N78§.4 million is earmarked for conipleting the first phase of the construction of a standard 1.435-metre gauge railway system parallel to the existing lines.
A gross under spending that was experienced by the railways during 1970-74 periods is avoided.
These railway development projects would include two new lines- the Ashaka railway extension to the Bauchi Cement Factory, on which N10 million should be spent, and the 194 kilometre Otukpo-Ajaokuta extension on which N108 million should be spent.
The later extensions help to transport cokable coal from the Lafia area to the proposed iron and steel complex at Ajaokuta (Fed.
Rep. of Nigeria, 1975, p.243-247).
5  With the current efforts at achieving complete dieselization and modernization of the railway gauge to conform with international standards, one can hope for a brighter prospect and more effective role for the Nigerian railways.
Student exercise: in your own opinion, enumerate reasons that led to the low level of operations of the Nigeria railways.
LUXURIOUS BUS 3.2 ROAD TRANSPORT HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT In its report the economic co-ordination of transport development in Nigeria, the Stanford Research Institute aptly stated that " the economic history of Nigeria is largely the story ofthe opening up of its vast areas by various fonn of transport" resulting in economic growth which, in tum, stimulated the demand for transport" (Robinson, 1961, p.36).
Indeed, one can go further to say that the twentieth century developmental history of Nigeria is the history of the extension and consolidation of the frontiers of social; political and eponomic development by means of road transport.
The history of road transport in Nigeria dated back to the first decade °fans century when the existing bush paths were developed into motorable routes, which were designed to serve two main objectives.
First, they were meant to extend the conunercial hinterlands opened up by the government railways for the evacuation of local exports products, by linking up the nearest urban centres with the major railway stations.
In this way, Oyo was linked with lbadan in 1906 by a railway operated road transport service and later Oshogbo with Ife, Ilesha and Ogbomosho (Walker, 1955).
The second objectives was to "reduce the strain thrown on the inland provinces in the provision of porters" for the British colonial officials.
6  After an initial period of slow growth, occasioned by financial and manpower constrains, the total length of road constructed and maintained by the governments and native authorities rose to about 51,000 km in 1946 and 74,000 lcm in 1960, out of which only 11% were tarred (Robinson, 1961, p.137).
By the end of the current plan period, there should be at least 100,000 km of roads of all classes in the country.
STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION OF ROAD TRANSPORT With the exception of community roads in the rural areas of the country, the planning and the development of the trunk and feeder roads are the responsibilities of the Federal, State and Local governments, all of which have been giving road devzlopment a well-deserved prioribr both in the development plans and in the annual capital programmes that have been earmarked for road development by the Federal and state governments during the third national development plan.
Overall, the nation is planning to spend one out of every six naira on the development of roads during 1975-80 plan periods.
This will amount to 72.84% of the total plan allocations to the entire transport sector.
Apart from the networks and terminals, which are public property, almost every other aspect of the transport industry in Nigeria belongs to the private sector.
The ownership and the operation of the good vehicles are responsibility of private entrepreneur,, although some state and local governments participated in the provision of passenger bus services on both intra-urban and intercity routes.
The bulk of passenger transportation is however, still performed by private companies and individuals with vehicles ranging from the five-seater passtenger cars to the 60-seater air-conditioned luxury buses.
The federal and state government exercise supreme control and supervision over the licensing of drivers, the importation, registration and licensing of all types of motor vehicles, and the regulation and orderly flow of traffic.
All these are achieved through the agencies of the licensing authorities; the vehicles inspection unity of the ministry of works, the Nigeria police force, the court and the board of customs and exercise.
ROAD TRANSPORT INTHETRIRD NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN The plamtng, development and maintenance of the road transport available in the countty have been largely conditioned by the principles of equity and efficiency, and the possibility of limiting public investments to mere provision of basic infrastructural facilities while the private sector provided the mobile facilities for the internal movement of goods and persons.
While it is true that "private road transport companies can be induced through government regulation to operate at optimum scales" (Filani  and Osayimwese, 1974, p.391), it appears that there is no escape from public mass transit system in the urban centre, if the growing traffic chaos, congestion, delays and the attendant manpower and material losses are to be arrested.
Unfortunately, however , the Nigerian experience in the provision of mass transit in the urban centres has been a dismal failure.
For passenger and commodity movements outside the major urban centres, a properly regulated private sector system can adequately cope with the indications that satisfactory progress is being made in these areas, with the exception of some rural-rural and rural-urban routes which are poorly served by vehicular transportation.
In governments or communities to develop the existing footpaths into motorable roads.

In recent years the country has experienced an unprecedented general economic boom which has led to the country's economy.
Because of its inherent advantage of speed, air transport has played a big role in passenger transport, especially, and has therefore contributed to the country's development.
The boom in the economy has enhanced the standard ofa living of many Nigerians such as businessmen and women, and professionals, who now travel by air not only to different parts of Nigeria, but also to various part of the world.
The general increase in the demand for air transport and the federal government's realization of its potential role in Nigeria's continued economic development have resulted in ever increasing capital investment in air transport ha.s been slcyrockeking.
For example, in the 1962-68 National Development Plan, capital expenditure on air transport (Civil Aviation and Nigerian Airways) amounted to N13.9 million (Fed.
Rep. Of Nigeria, 1962).
This figure increased about four- fold to N51.3 million in the second National Development Plan (1975,80) a total of N527.9 million was eannarIced for air transport and represented 7.2% of the total investment in the transport sector (Fed.
Rep. of Nigeria, 1975).

NIGERIA AIRWAYS AND FLEETS STRENGTH Nigeria Airways was established in October 1958 as a joint venture between the Nigerian Government, Elder Dempster Lines, and the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) with shareholding of 51, 322/3 and 161/3% respectively (Stanford Research Inst.
1961).
The Airways thus took over the operation of domestic flight from the disbanded West African Airways Corporation (WAAC) which liad been operating commercial aircraft within the country since 1946 (Filani, 1975a).
In 1963 the Nigerian Federal Government bought out the other shareholders and Nigerian Airways became wholly-owned by the Nigerian government.
The airline has a monopoly for providing domestic air services in Nigeria.
It is also the national flag carrier for international services along the West African Coast.
The airline operates flights to Abidjan, Accra, Robersfield , Freetown, Bathurst and Dakar and also on the recently opened routes to Lome, Niamey, Cotonou, and to Nairobi, Kenya.
The Nigeria Airways is in pool agreement with British Caledonian Airways and together they account for over 50% of Nigeria's international traffic to London, Rome, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and New York.
In 1976 Nigeria Airways operated a fleet of nineteen aircraft consisting of two each Boeings 707 and 737 and one DC 10-30 aircraft used mainly for international flights; seven F.28 jets, and seven fokker F.27 propeller aircraft used mainly on domestic routes.
The F.28 aircraft operate the west African Coast Services and the major lines of domestic services from Lagos to Kaduna - Kano; Benin- Enugu , and to Port Harcourt-Calabar.
Apart from Nigeria Airways other major international airlines which operate flights to Nigeria include Lufthansa, UTA, Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines,1CLM, Aer(Iflot, British Caledonian Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Air Zaire, Air Affique, therebyfinking Nigeria with the world's major socio-economic and political centers" ;Within Nigeria itself, several charter companies operate additional flight in small aircraft from Lagos to the main economic centers in the southern parts  of the coiintry.
Such companies include Pan African Airlines, Aero Contractors Company, Delta Maritime and Aeronautical Company and Tropical Aircrafts Sales Limited which provide non-schedule air-taxi and cargo services to locations approved by the government; Bristol Helicopters Limited charters helicopters to the oil companies.
Also some individuals, missionary and business groups, the Federal and State Governement functionaries operate small fixed aircraft (Filani, 1975a).
 , 9  INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC TRAFFIC Within the last one and a half decades Nigeria has witnessed an enormous expansion in both domestic international traffic.
However, most of it has been in domestic traffic, which has accounted for more than 70% of the total air traffic handled by Nigeria Airways.
A comparison with other major African airlines shows the predominance of the domestic traffic Research shows that of the eleven major airlines in Africa in 1972, Nigeria ranked 8" in terms of total number of passengers carried but fifth in terms of aircraft departures.
Of the 286.769 passengers carried, 200, 628, or 70%, were in domestic flights.
In other words more than two-thirds of passengers handled by the Airways were in domestic flights.
On the other hand for airline such as Air Algeria, Tunisia air, and Egypt airlines more than two-thirds of their total passengers were carried on international flights, which indicates that these airlines had a stronger and better foot-hold in international air traffic market than their Nigerian counterpart.
The high percentage of domestic traffic for the new definict East African Airways was due to the fact that services among the three countries - Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania were then regarded as domestic.

10  In terms of freight carried, Nigeria Airways did better on international flights.
In the same year, 1972, 2355 tonnes of freight were carried by the airline.
Of these 1643, or 69.8%, were on international flights while only 712 tonnes or 30.2% were in domestic flights.
Thus, in 1972, while most of Nigeria airways' passengers were on domestic flights most of its freight traffic was international.
A comparison between the total number of passengers carried and the number of aircraft departures show that the average number of passengers per aircraft departure for Nigeria Airways was only 20 compared with Air Algeria which recorded 54 in the same period.
This low figure shows Nigeria Airways' poor performance in attracting passengers.
This poor performance is however, more on international routes than on domestic routes, which have been recording high load factors comparable to world averages (Filani, 1975a).

THE ROLE OF AIR TRANSPORT IN NIGERIA'S DEVELOPMENT In a rapidly developing economy like that of Nigeria, the role of air transport cannot be overemphasized.
In recent years air transport has contributed towards progress in commercial and other business transactions.
However, the importance of air lies more in its future potential than in its past contributions to the nation's economic development.

4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, we've been able to examine the historical development of rail road and air transportation in Nigeria and the ways they're contributed to the country's economic growth.
5.0 SUNEVIARY  This unit has introduced you to a broad profile of different modes of transport existing in Nigeria (excluding water and pipeline transport).
 Starting from railway to air travel every travel, every mode of transport is important keeping in mind, the different physical conditions of our country and varied interests and demands of the commuters.
 What we need today is to develop an integral plan in order to move forward creativity and economically.
 With technology advancing everyday, transport industry needs reorientation accordingly and this is an essential pre-requisite for the development of tourism.
Answer to student assessment question A World Bank mission visited Nigeria in 1953 and recommended an extension of the railways, i.e.
if Nigeria was to meet an anticipated (what she is aiming to achieve) expansion of agriculture production in the north-eastern part of the country.
The mission also, after putting two alternatives was likely to prove more advantageous in the end.

It involves a relationship between "host" cultures and "guest" cultures, ecological and environmental considerations and a fine balance between factors pertaining to leisure and those pertaining to efficiency.
These factors are, in addition to the usual commercial aspects of the business.
In a world that is increasingly being reduced to a "global village" the tourist as a consumer is also conscious of the need to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the "host" cultures they are visiting.
It should be recognized that in this context there is a healthy tension that can develop between the interests of the host culture, the interests of the tourists and the interests of the commercial organisations such as hoteliers, tour operators and other agencies.
It is not possible in this Unit to explore all issues in detail in addition to various issues involved such as marketing, operational and financial in the accommodation sector.
However, a fundamental aim of the unit is to address these issues and bring it to the forefront as a basic ingredient in the success of the tourist oriented hospitality product.
2.0 OBJECTIVES In this unit we shall attempt a general survey of the nature of tourist accommodation.
It is intended that after reading this unit you will: - Have a clear idea of the main factors that must be considered when viewing aspects of tourist accommodation, Be able to have a perspective on tourist accommodation in general in the hospitality industry, Know about the structure and nature of different types of accommodation, Learn about various types of accommodation needs of tourists and leam about the ecological and environmental considerations in developing different types of accommodations.
3.1 VARIOUS TYPES OF ACCOMMODATION It may be asked why we refer to "tourist accommodation" when in fact we are talking about hotels.
On the face of it, this is true, but the word "hotel" has a very defined sense and conjures images of a multi-storied building with anywhere from 100 to 600 rooms.
In fact, the tourist avails of such accommodation also, 15  but the kinds of tourists are so varied and the nature of tourist activity is such that the facilities that are used by tourist have to be described in more specific terms.
For example, there are some tourists who vvish to travel on a very small budget; they would probably stay at homes of friends in the larger city, and once they go to a more remote place, let us say Ikogosi, they would look for a guest house where they would want a clean bed and toilet facilities at the very most.
In addition they may also want to have breakfast there.
Alternately, there are very rich tourists who will stay in the five star deluxe category of hotels in the large city and seek to stay in very exclusive resorts on a remote beach in Lagos area.
A quick survey of the destinations tells us that both these categories of facilities are available to the guest.
This is applicable to both domestic as well as foreign tourists.
It is important, therefore; that a tourism professional be aware of all categories of accommodation, at least in broad terms, and be able to think clearly about which ones they may wish to identify for their client/guest.
Let us briefly consider each of the various categories of accommodation.
FIVE STAR DELUXE HOTELS These are usually to be found in the metropolitan city areas, and have anywhere between 200 to 800 rooms.
Some hotels in this category have thousand rooms in their inventory.
They are categorized by certain international standards which include a given number of restaurants, a particular size of lobby, business center facilities, a swimming pool etc., including, of course, very strict standards of quality control.
These hotels are usually used primarily by the business executives (often 90 percent of the customers are business men and women) and the very upscale tourists.
There are other star categories like three star, one star, etc.
However, categorization into stars is still in progress in Nigeria.
Hotels offer themselves for categorization which is based on certain criteria and inspection by officials.
FIRST CLASS HOTELS These are a step down from the above category, but contain most of the facilities that are provided in the "five star deluxe" hotels.
These are also located usually in the large metropolitan cities and some mid-sized cities as well.
These hotels also used by a combination of business executives and tourists.
16  'ON-STAR HOTELS At every tourist destination you come across many small hotels who don't come under classified categories.
Yet many tourists stay there as per their budget adjustments.
But many tourists cannot afford it and they stay in small staying places near the beach.
Such examples are abundant at every destination be it a hill station or a pilgrimage centre.
RESORTS AND LODGES These are meant almost exclusively for the tourists and more often are found in so-called "off the beaten track" destinations.
In some countries, where the economic dependence on tourism is very great, such accommodation can also be found in the cities or just outside the cities.
Thus, in Kenya for example, one can find very elaborate lodges even in Nairobi, the capital city where most tourists enter the country.
The Resorts and Lodges usually have certain features such as elaborate swimming pools, a balcony or patio overlooking each room and entertainment facilities.
In India for example, there are beach resorts, Hill resorts and Wild life resorts.
These resort hotels commonly cater to tourist of different tastes and budgets.
Whether luxury or low budget resorts they primarily offer a stay in the natural surroundings.
These resorts are generallcr seasonal.
Student Exercise 1: explain the difference between Resort Hotels and conventional city hotels.
TENTED CAiIPS While most of the types of accommodation so far involve solid structures a type that is fast gaining popularity around the world is the tented camp variety.
These involve relatively low investment.
These are ecologically very friendly in that they do not threaten to spoil the landscape too much and can be set up seasonally to reduce expenditure by not having to spend too much on the upkeep of the place when the tourist season is over.
Another variation of the tented camp is tftsmobile tented camps which are used when treldcing in various parts of the world.
17  HERITAGE HOTELS Tourists visiting a historical city are very fond of historical palaces.
Often they dream of staying in the same way and styles as that of Rajas.
Keeping in view this tourist interest the govemment of India's Tourism Department started encouraging Heritage Hotels.
By providing financial incentives to*, owners of forts, palaces and havelis the tourism department encourages the owners to convert their properties into heritage hotels have come up in many areas.
A near similar to heritage hotels in Nigeris is the colonial Guest Houses.
GUEST HOUSES The guest house is to be found in cities, towns and even remote destinations.
Usually those who use these facilities are individuals who travel on their own, spend relatively longer periods of time in a particular destination, wish to get to know the hot culture intimately and want their expenditure to be modest.
Therefore, they have only one or two meals a day and spend the rest of the time outside the guest house.
More often than not, the guest house is run by a family and although they do so in a very efficient maimer, the operations are not what might be called "professionally" managed and the tourist is often living, literally, as a "gust" of a family.
The house boat accommodation is a unique example of this category.
In Nigeria, guest houses are owned mostly by the government and various Institutions around the country.
Recently in different tourist places the system of paying guest accommodation is gaining much popularity.
This has two basic purposes: Firstly tourists coming from outside Nigeria or from various regions of Nigeria for example are generally fond of local eriquette, household, culture and home made food.
Compared to staying in hotels which provide typical hotel culture, more or less same everywhere, staying with a local family at tourist places is both economical and informative for lmowing the local people and their culture Secondly, paying guest accommodation provided the local with a source of earning without any investment as well as the opportunity to learn different cultures.
ALTERNATIVE ACCOMMODATION While the above are some of the broad categories into which the types of accommodation are divided, there are a whole range of other types of accommodation such as the small boarding houses which are converted into socalled "guest houses", the YMCA and YWCA facilities, lodges managed by tourism 18  departments and "tourist camps".
Some of these Could also be termed the unorganised sector of the hospitality industry and should be kept in mind when a professional in the tourism industry is informing his or her potential customer of the options available for accommodation purposes.
One can also recommend for short or overnight stay in the rest rooms of the railways.
In concluding this section it is important to keep in mind that generally speaking the tourist spends approximately 40 percent of his funds on room and board.
Thus it is imperative that any advice, suggestion or recommendation that is given in this regard must be carefully considered and discussed in great detail.
The burden of accomplishing this rest with the tomism professional and not necessarily with the customer, who is not always aware of the options available at a given destination.
It goes without saying that each of the above types of accommodation has its own advantages and disadvantages.
But what is different about the tourist accommodation is that it must incorporate specialized activities (unique recreational and educational) into its architectural design.
Similarly, innovative meal plans (often quite elaborate) are also a customer's needs that must be taken into account.
In any attempt to promote them the tourism professional should carefully consider them, understand the perspective of the potential customer and promote the correct category accordingly.
Similarly, if each specific category is examined in detail one will discover that there are various price ranges in each and this too should be kept in mind when protnoting the acconimodation portion of the tour to the prospective customer.
3.2 SOME PRINCIPAL CONSIDERATIONS As has already been pointed out in the introduction, the business of promoting tourist accommodation is a very complex affair, which requires the tourism professional to be aware of several factors at once including:  Host/guest culture relations,  Ecological/environmental considerations,  and Leisure activity.
Given the above, the best way to consider the factors that are involved in any assessment of tourist accommodation is to pretend as if you are "building" a tourist oriented hotel and look at the main conunercial aspects of this exercise while taking into account factor such as those mentioned above.
This involves asldng the correct questions at the time of building the accommodation and, by extension, also when you are promoting it.
19  It should be understood that the terms we have used to discuss the main considerations in tourist accommodation (marketing, operations and financials) do not pertain to the actual running of a hotel or resort; this is a very specialized and detailed task.
Rather, the terms in our context have to do with attempting to give you a comprehensive understanding of what is needed in a hotel or resort that function well in the current tourism scenario.
Student Exercise: You are successful in convincing the chairman of your local government to invest in tourist accommodation business.
What are the factors you will advice him to consider?
MARKETING Someone once defined marketing quite briefly as "knowing what the customer wants".
Simple as this may sound, it assumes a clear understanding of the complexity of the tourists needs and, most importantly the ability of your organisation to deliver what is promised.
Thus, like in the case of any other product it is critical that there is substantial marketing input at the product planning stages of tourist accommodation, precisely because of the complexity of tourist behaviour and needs.
In addition to the above, in today's world of tourism it is not just whether you have the right customer, the right location, the right package and the right price.
The tourism professional is also required to take into consideration whether the particular accommodation, being promoted is ecologically and environmentally sound.
We will enter into a discussion of this as we consider further studies in the future, but for the moment it should be mentioned that ecological and environmental "correctness", while important for any segment of tourist accommodation, &comes more important where its impact is increased.
As the impact increases, it should be pointed out, whenever the location is remote or exotic.
The same would apply for host/guest culture relations.
By definitiont, a place that is remote or "exotic" is the ultimate tourist destination.
Quite logically, "what the customer wants" is determined by who the customer is, and it would not be wrong to say that the more the customer tends to spend, the more awire he or she is of services at times social concerns.
Therefore, as a rough barometer, it would be accurate to say that the more a customer is willing to pay, 20  the more questions he or she is apt to ask.
These could be about the precautions being talcen by you to minimise social and ecological damage caused by their activities or related to having all luxury without any concerns.
Tourism professionals should therefore make this an integral part of their marketing strategy to convincingly answer the queries in addition to other commercial considerations.
FURTHER CONSIDERATIONS (OPERATIONAL) We have already made passing mention of several aspects of the operations of a tourist accommodation.
It would be helpful to briefly summarize these by way of a review and then discuss some other operational features of such organisations: a) FOOD & BEVERAGE (F&B): This, of course is a feature of any hospitality industry product.
However in the case of tourist hotels and resorts the F &B departments need to be considerably more flexible; at times for example, the tourist may wish not to have lunch in the resort, but take a picnic lunch instead.
In such instances it is important that this is anticipated and the quality of service is enhanced.
Similarly, the eating habits of people on holiday tend to be different than a "manager" in conventional sense of that word.
In fact, the management of smaller resorts and hotels need to be versatile.
This "flexibility" might be the motto of a good resort when it comes to its operations.
3.3 WHO USES TOURIST ACCO1VIMODATION There are different kinds of tourist.
Therefore, it stands to reason that a tourist resort must cater to each category of tourist.
It will of course be impossible for us to discuss each of the myriad of category of tourist individually at this rime.
However, let us look at the broad categories of tourist in the organised sector of the market and see how each would be different and how they are handled by the particular tourist resort-hotel.
Let us begin by first identifying the various categorise of tourist who uses a tourist resort: i) The frequent individual traveler or FIT, is the category of tourist who make their own customized itineraries with the help of a tour operator or travel agent.
They travel either alone or in groups of up to six individuals.
These customers often wish to be given personalized treatment.
Along these lines they are more demanding as they often design their itinerary as they go along and do not wish to be handed a "package" that is difficult or expensive to change.
21  ii) Then there are the group inclusive travelers or GIT.
This category of tourists often purchases -a package tour and can range from ten to over one hundred in number.
On the average, however, they would number 30 or so passengers although that too depends on the destination and the product.
3.4 HOW TO GET INFORMATION It is necessary for a tourism professional to obtain necessary information about accommodation available at a destination.
But how to get it?
Well it is not a difficult thing today.
The most informative source is the Hotel and restaurant guide published every year by the federation of hotel and restaurant associations of any place.
This kind is not yet available in Nigeria.
It contains information regarding different type of hotels, tariffs, rooms' available address, telephone number and other facilities available.
Similarly, all promotional brochures of tourism department list the types of accommodation available at a destination.
All you have to do is to walk into a tourism department office to get it.
Often you read advertisements in the big hotels carry their own promotional campaigns.
You should also keep information about the retiring room facilities at railway stations as:Stony tourists use them for temporary stays particularly those who are always on the move.
Another aspect is to get advance booking done for the individual/group or else the tourist may land in difficulties.
PROPOSAL FORA CAMP RESORT Let us, as a case study mention an acconunodation proposal for your benefit.
It is important to reznember that Obudu Cattle Ranch as a destination is popular among well-travelled customers who are keen to visit any "off-the-beaten-track" destination.
In other words, they have traveled to many other parts of the world and have chosen Obudu Cattle Ranch for its exotic "backpacker" whose itinerary is not pre- determined and whose spending power is limited.
The promoters of the project under review intend to target the well traveled discerning client.
It is planned that our primary market will be the individual traveller and some select groups.
It is intended thM the project will consist of 20 huts built along traditional Obudu Cattle Ranch style.
The rooms will be approximately 15' x 15' in size, 9' in height.
The huts will be paced in an unobtrusive niatmer, each hut having a substantial view from its window and veranda area.
22  The interior of the hut will be fully modernized and contain a minimum of two twin beds, tow rugs, tow bedside tables, a dressing table, two bedside lamps and a closet to hang clothes.
The bathrooms will have a sink, shower and bathtub and towels racks.
Central to the camp-resort will be a hall, which will serve as a central dining hut and activities area.
The hall will consist of three general areas, viz a central diping room with fireplace, a recreational area where groups can letnige, pllty giartletSttend a lecture, and a reading room area which will house a selection of booki:the public area will be decorated with rare Nigerian artefacts.
In this way the property will have some unique facilities that are thus far not available around.
Part of the inventory of the property will also be slide projector anti scre-en whidt withassist in the lectures and talks that the management of the property wish to actualize through invitations to guest speakers and performances.
The ancillary facilities will consist of a kitchen, a pantry/storage area, an office room and staff quarters.
The property will also grow its own vegetables and, should it provide to be profitable, also start a small poultry farm.
In this way, it is indented that the project be fully, self-sufficient and caters for its immediate needs on its own.
You will appreciate that the proposal has been made keeping in view the specific local style etc.
Similar proposals can be made for different areas.
Students self assessment questions: Mention and explain the 2 kinds of travelers that use tourist accommodation.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, we have discussed extensively every necessary information about kinds of accommodation and alternative accommodation, marketing and those that uses tourist accommodation including ways of getting information.
5.0 SUMNIARY  After studying this unit, it should now be clear that under no Circumstances "tourist accommodation" is a simplistic exercise.
 Whether you are involved in building it or in promoting it, it is in some ways a more complex issue to address.
23   Understanding the existing market and the nature of tourist demand is most essential.
 Ecological, environmental and social considerations also should be important determinants in this exercise.
 ICnowledge of different types of accommodation and the specific characteristics of each category of accommodation along with information of booking should always be in the finger tips of a tourist professional.
 As far as the operations of such a property are concerned, one needs to juggle efficiency with varied demands and cater to customers who have paid a large variety in their tariffs depending on whether they have travelled as a group or as individual.
Student Self assessment with answers: i) The frequent individual travelers (FIT) - this is the category of tourist who make their own customarized itinerates with the help of a tour operator or a travel agent.
They travel either alone or in groups of up to six individuals.
The group inclusive travelers (GIT) - this category of tourist often purchase a package tour and can range from ten to over hundred in numbers.
On the average, they would number 30 passengets.

Besides providing direct employment it also stimulates the need for a number of services that are subsidiary in nature.
This, in turn, provided indirect employment and also has an impact on the local economy.
However, the type of subsidiary senrices reqnired deppld on the form of tourism promoted.
For example: Luxury foreign tourists demand services that are vastly different from the demand of low budget tourists or domestic tourists, and Services required at adventure tonrism destinations would be different from those required at pilgrim destinations, etc.
Formerly we had discussed the importance of informal services.
This unit takes into account seryices like tourist police, link transport, performing arts, communications, etc.
Certain other categories like photography, publishing tourism related literature, etc.
have also been discussed.
The information provided in this unit is of help for tourism professionals in many ways.
For example, while marketing a destination some of these services can be offered in the package; a tourist can be advised on what is available and cautioned as to what will not be there.
Similarly those who want to start small- scale enterprises can loolc into these services and choose as per therequirements in their areas etc.
2.0 OBJECTIVES In this unit the intention is to familiarise you with certain such services that are needed to back up the tourism system i.e., the subsidiary services.
After reading this unit you should be able to know about the:  Categories of some of the subsidiary services and the role played by each one of them in tourism,  Avenues available for subsidiary services,  Opportunities available for self enterprise in the area,  Shortcomings of the subsidiary services, and  Problems in the nature of the jobs thrown open by tourism.
26  3.1 COMNION SERVICES Subsidiary services develop naturally in the process of urbanisation.
It is a curious feature of tourism that as it opens up remote places (which are often attractive because they are underdeveloped), it creates the demand for services which are generally not required by local residents.
For example an airconditioned taxi will not be the demand of locals.
LINK TRANSPORT NEEDS Tourists' movements at the destination and nearby attractions give demand to local transport needs.
This demand first emerges from the very point where the tourist disembarks from the main transport i.e.
railway station, airport or bus stand.
Different agencies cater to this demand.
For example, take the case from an airport:  Govenunent transport corporations ply their buses to different routes, to specific point in the city or connecting the airport with bus stand and railway station,  Airlines ply their coaches up to certain points in the city.
However, besides these there are other popular modes to cater to this service.
For example:  Taxis on hire are available for local transportation as well as long routes.
There are separate counters for local prepaid taxis and long route taxis,  Auto ricicshaws are also available, and  At the railway stations and bus stops one finds other services also like, auto bikes commonly referred to locally as "okada".
Taxi operators get a special chance with the growth of tourism in a region particularly when the tourists visiting the area are high budget luxury tourist.
They need private transport to complete their travel as speedily as possible during their brief holiday.
Some local unemployed youth often with the help of loans from nationalise banks, run motorcycle taxi services.
For a fee - which is naturally lower than four-wheeler taxi rates - the commuter is transported to some destinations, whether in the state small towns, or to villages beyonds.
27  Such motorcycle "pilots", (like okada in Nigeria as they are locally called) used to ply on state roads even before the current tourism boom.
But, the influx of tourists to some parts of the state has given a fillip to their business.
These motorcycle taxis are treated as legal taxis and the idea seems to be catching on in a few other pockets of the country.
In some areas two wheelers are also given on hire to tourists.
It is hoped that when the business of tourism becomes buoyant in Nigeria too, the so-called okada' could be given more recognition as a result of their flexibility of operation in cities like Lagos for example with its present traffic problem.
Some luxury hotels prefer to run their own luxury bus or transport service.
This in tum cuts down on the employment potential available to taxi-operators.
EATING JOINTS AND BARS Different types of eating joints cater to the tourists.
These range from restaurants and tea stalls and fast food counters.
Many small entrepreneurs with little capital can go in for small business in this area.
Here one has to keep in mind that perfect hygiene conditions are maintained.
Local cuisine is generally popular with tourist.
One should not initiate western foods or joints but also give due importance to local foods and customs related with it.'
ENTERTAINMENT AND RECREATION Entertainment is an essential component in tourism.
This may include dance, theatre, movie, theme dinner, musical evening etc.
At many destinations this has provided employment to local artists and performers.
Local dances, music and songs from a part of the experience.
Similarly many hotels organise musical nights or dance performances during the tourist season.
Certain countries offer grambling, casinos and night clubs as entertainment but this is not the case with Nigeria yet.
This is perhaps one reason that those who demand such services find entertainment very dull in Nigeria.
TOURIST POLICE In states like Goa and Kerela in India for example, we now have tourist police and the idea is picking up.
The concept is rather new and unusual.
The nature of 28  work does not include crime detection or traffic control.
Rather a smartly attired tourist policeman is supposed to guide tourists politely regarding their needs and to answer queries.
Besides he also takes care of their security needs with special concern, if needed.
There are no tourist police in Nigeria as of now.
The present state of security is infact one of the many reasons restricting tourist flow in Nigeria.
COMMUNICATIONS It has been mentioned earlier that tourism involves being away from home and work environment.
But at the same time while away the tourist does want to occasionally communicate back home with family members and friends or parcel a gift.
Writing their own experience, feelings, etc.
are common features.
Hence, communication services like post office and public call booths are there at the-destinations or in the nearby towns etc.
In recent years the number of STD/ISD booths has gone up to take care of such a demand.
At the same time a tourism professional must inform the would be tourists about the availability of such services at a destination.
You can imagine the fate of a tourist who wanted to ring his friends but it is only at the destination that he comes to know about non-availability of ISD.
Had he known.eirlier he could have rung from the airport itself.
PHOTOGRAPHY One of the most popular services at destinations is that of photographers.
Tourists not only like to have photographs in the surrounding but, also in the costume and attire of the region they visit.
Take for example the Lekki Beach a destination near the city of Lagos.
Many photographers there keep the dress and tourist changes into that attire for a snap.
This is very popular with domestic tourists.
Besides catering to the needs of those who have their own cameras, film rolls, camera batteries etc.
are also sold.
Student exercise 1: discuss the role of link transport in tourism.
3.2 DESTINATION SPECIFIC SERVICES There are certain services which are specific to a destination or to the type of tourism.
For example:  Life guards are needed at beaches,  Renting out tents, sleeping bags, sports shoes, rain coats, sticks, trekking and rock 29   climbing equipment etc.
at hill stations.
 Services related to water sports,  Coolies and porters as per requirements,  Hawkers selling different items, e.g.
mats at beaches, photo cards, cold drinks, etc.
 Joy rides on ponies, horses, camels and elephants are per the availability at a destination,  Massage clinics or individual masseuis,  Fishing kits for angling at beaches or water side resorts, providing binoculars, and  Guides, pathfinders etc.
as per requirements Besides these there are many other services like boating, ride in a tom-tom, byscope, theatre, cinema, etc.
3.3 CATERING TO DIVERSE NEEDS The subsidiary or informal services both build up a demand for providing further services to back them up.
For example, maintenance of larger and smaller hotels projects would also require the services of a number of skilled and unskilled persons.
Plumbers, electricians, waiters, cooks, watchmen, washer-men, laundrymen, etc.
will be required.
Similarly for eating joints vegetable, mutton, etc are required so some one has to provide".
For transport drivers, often such services would be required and the type (*employment offered would also depend on the size and number of services rehuired, 3.4 THE ARGUMENT OF JOBS One argument in favour of promoting tourism is that it demands services and thus create many more jobs.
In fact the demand for subsidiary services differs significantly depending on the type of tourist visiting an area:  In case they are high budget tourists the demand will be higher because of their capacity to pay and the fact that they are used to a certain amount of facilities.
 In contrast low budget tourist would go for simpler and less costly services.
Hence, there would always be a fluctuation in the demand of service.
The vagaries and uncertainties of the tourist season add to these fluctuations.
The earnings by the local population also depend on the unpredictable external factors on which the local people have no control.
For example civil unrest, war, etc.
can 30  affect tourist arrivals at a destination.
This degionstrates the vulnerability of international tourism and unemployment at a destination.
This also leads to migration of a number of persons to other parts.
A critical view that is gaining ground, and not without substance, is that where tourism is controlled chiefly by outside interest management the upper level personnel are usually outsiders.
The bulk positions occupied by locals tend to be of lower status and pay.
This dichotomy has to be taken care of for a healthy and sustainable development of tourism.
Student exercise II: explain kinds of opportunities the local people can derive from tourism Student Assessment questions.
1 What do you think is responsible for the demand to local transport?
2.
Mention at least 5 destination specific services Answer: 1.
Tourist movements at the destination and nearby attractions.
2.
Destination specific services are: i) life guards at the beaches ii) services related to water sports iii) hawkers selling different items iv) joy rides on horses, elephants etc.
v) guides, pathfinders etc.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit you're learnt about categories of subsidiary services, a venues available for subsidiary services, opportunity, shortcomings and problems in the rature of tourism jobs.
5.0 SUMMARY  Subsidiary services emerge becatice of the demand created by tourism.
 Because of their dependence on tourism they remain seasonal in nature  There are certain services that are conunon to all destinations whereas certain services are specific to a destination.
 The demand for one service often leads to another service that is needed as a backaP.
31  6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments question: There are certain services which are specific to certain destinations or to the type of tourism.

Similarly if you are a small entrepreneur you may have to decide what to sell and how to sell.
In fact shopping is an important agenda for a tourist and some time is always allotted for this in any itinerary.
Some countries of the world have a rich tradition of various handicrafts, bandlooms and other art works produced by artisans.
These not only represent such country's heritage and culture but at the same time are great shopping attractions for tourists.
Most of the foreign tourists coming to a country.
want to leam about its culture.
This is equally true in the case of domestic tourists visiting another region of their country.
Culture is best absorbed by acquainting oneself with language, food, dress, and traditional arts and crafts.
The arts are presented through periodic programmes of music, dance, theatre, temporary exhibitions of paintings and photography, etc.
At the same time it is the acquisition of crafts and textiles sensibilities and iiems that form part of the daring lives of its people.
It is for this reason that shops and emporia play an important part as shoe windows.
These tend to be centred in large cities, competing with high tecimology, mass produced and aggressively advertised consumer products.
From small towns and villages, crafts or locally made rural products are fast disappearing.
Where do we find them?
How do we preserve them?
How do we create new shops to serve them?
These are important questions for the small entrepreneur and also for those involved in the promotion of tourism.
This unit starts with a discussion on the traditional marketing outlets of handicrafts.
Certain seasonal festivals have also become tourist attractions where various craft products are on sale.
This is another selling outlet taken care of in the unit.
.
Further the role of the emporia and private shops has also been discussed.
The unit also takes into account the marketing organisations at the grassroot levels.
An important aspect dealt with is the life of artisans and certain efforts that are being initiated to improve conditions for them.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you will be able to learn about:  the various shopping attractions of tourists,  traditional and modem handicraft marketing structures in Nigeria,  the artisans and crafts people served by such institutions.
34  3.1 'THE VILLAGE AND SMALL TOWN MARKET 'The concept of inarketing evolved as an offshoot of the advent of technology.
In early times the potter both tnan and woman, but mostly the latter, moulded mud pots by hand for domestic use.
Once the potters' wheel was invented and production increased, the excess quantity produced became items for distribution to others through the exchange of goods.
If goods and services between two needy parties matched, the barter system came into play.
When the purchaser of the commodity had nothing worthy of exchange, the monetary system was introduced when goods were exchanged for money.
In self-sufficient village economics, land owners would sell their agricultural produce while village artisans sold their goods such as ropes, baskets, iron ware, cloth, metal vessels and agricultural implements.
These would be exchanged or bought by the very same society that brought goods to the market.
All sorts of activity takes place in such a scene where apart from exchange and trade of goods, ear cleaning, medicinal remedies, tattooing, astrological predictions and entertainment through song.
A typical village or small town market place is therefore the most indigenous, flexible, and at the same time multi-layered and infinitely complex structure which accommodates economic activities of various natures.
In many parts of Nigeria there are informal marketplaces called Oja' .
These are generally seen in village clusters, small towns and even capital cities.
They operate either one day a weelc, twice a week, for a few hours a day or even everyday.
The rural market place called oja depending on which part of the country, it is most a mirror image of village society and its life.
Thus each market is a display of the products, skills and culture of that particular area.
The marketplace in any rural area best conveys the vitality and dynamics of village life and is the basic arena for local trading.
These are the characteristics that attract many tourists to the market who also know that what they are going to buy is the genuine local product of the artisan.
3.2 SEASONAL AND FESTIVAL CELEBRATIONS In countries like India which are still largely based on agricultural practices and steeped in religious practices, most fairs and festivals are times of celebration.
They linlc a bountiful harvest season with religious or methodological events such as Boli, Pongal, Onam, Diwali, Baisakhi, tribal celebrations, Id, or Christmas, and Sango, yam festival, yearly marriage festival in Saare in K wara State of Nigeria.
35  Student Exercise 1: Explain your experience of visiting a local market in your area.
3.3 THE EMPORIUMS During the freedom struggle in India Mahatma Gandhi very often referred to the importance of cottage industries.
His concept of Swadeshi meant the sustenance of employment in rural areas, self reliance, the boycott of foreign goods, and the spiritual benefit oflearning to appreciate handwork.
The powerful symbols of the Charka to mobilize every citizen to spin yarn at home and give work to the handloom weaver to produce cloth, and thus undermine the dominance of British Textile mills created the great Khacli movement.
Garnients marketed by multinational corporations also destroy our local skills and employment and repatriate their profits out of India.
The common traditional native hand-woven cloth similar to above is our local "Aso ofi" common in Iseyin and Oyo, in Oyo State of Nigeri4.
In the late sixties and early seventies, the all India Handicrafts and Handloom Board directed the development of crafts and their marketing.
It helped each state government to set up state emporia or shops to sell the conventional handicrafts of their states.
Each name has a special meaning and a history behind it which is worth exploring and discovering.
Not only are the emporia the show window of crafts and handlooms, they also present a cultural picture of the entire state.
Jewellery, fabrics, woodwork, metalwork, metalware, stonework, embroideries, carpets, rugs and shawls — all sorts of omaments, artefacts, decorative and utilitarian articles arising out of particular regions, communities and cultures from a composite whole of each state.
The emporia are usually well stocked but a customer must look carefully to select between high and medium quality goods.
The emporium serves the purpose of marketing goods for rural and urban craftspeople, and thus provide them with regular earnings.
However, it is not always possible to keep only high quality items and reject the mediocre, simply hicause the manufacturer may be poor and thus unable to invest in either adequate time or high quality raw materials to produce a fine quality product.
36  It is however the role of the emporium to guide production of items according to the requirements of city clientele.
The customer can be assured of prices that are not varying and over-inflated, and the quality is of a very satisfactory standard.
Nowhere else in the world can such a wide variety of crafts, displaying immense creativities and artistic skill be found?
India can boast of the widest selection of handicrafts and hand woven or decorated textiles.
Here, the emporia serve the purpose of keeping the arts, crafts and markets alive.
They allow private enterprise to complete, imitate or excel, yet, at least ensure sustenance of skill and production.
Nigeria is not lagging behind in the production of quality textiles and different handicrafts.
There has been exhibition of standard handicrafts of various sizes and designs in seminars etc.
where products of various types made of raffia etc.
are displayed and showcased.
3.4 PRIVATE SHOPS, BOUTIQUES CO-OPERATIVE OUTLETS: The entrepreneurial instinct of Nigeria trading coMmunities has been fine tuned over centuries and generations.
The survival instinct of those who have to find their place in an increasingly commercialized and consumerist society create clever business people out of pavement dwellers as well as high society womenfolk.
Dull shops transform into glittering boutiques overnight if "fashion" and "demand" is in the air.
On pavements in Lagos young boys do a brisk in selling crisp sizzling friend in butter before your very eyes.
Hawkers are found in cities and towns all over Nigeria, but have not organised themselves into unions.
Shops catering to the souvenir inclined tourist often put "government approved" on their name board to assure customers of their honesty and quality.
It does not necessarily hold true.
Many shops at high tourist towns such as Agra, Jaipur, Srinagar and Varanasi in India and Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Port Harcourt in Nigeria fiercely compete and employ tourists or agents to bring unwary tourist from tours, airports, bus terminals, stations and hotels.
Often the more sober and reliable government shops lose out because they do not follow such practices.
On the other hand certain shops are more eager to please and efficient private proprietors gain long lasting contacts through personalised and energetic salesmanship.
Large cosmopolitan cities abound in boutiques - small exclusive shops with selected goods most often sold at fairly high prices.
Customers pay for the airconditioning, the decor, the general atmosphere of sophisiication and 37  exclusive products.
It is the wealthy who do not mind paying three or four times the goods worth for such perquisites.
Boutiques specialize in either "designer" style ready-made garments or personally selected handloom cotton and silk saris.
Some deal in "art objects" which are genuine or imitation collector's items.
All metropolitan cities like London, Beyina, New York, Delhi and Bombay in India, Lagos and Kano are best equipped with a variety of private shops and shopping complexes suited for tourists who want to buy from amongst the pre- selected best, and find newly designed good quality handicrafts and textiles which are not available at commonplace shops and markets.
The co-operative society, as an important organisation for the unified marketing of rural products, has been quite successful in some states in India for the handloom sector in particular.
Each state has its own co-operative laws.
It will first be necessary to find out whether marketing societies are allowed whether they are to be organised federations and their goods are bought by the apex body and sold through shops all over the country.
The proper management of a co-operative society requires honest and open dealing so that each member benefits equally from the profits of the society.
Records have to be carefully maintained and submitted before the registrar of cooperatives regularly.
Subsidies, rebates and other preferential benefits are provided to co-operative societies.
This has been a common practice in Nigeria over the years.
Student exercise II: explain the fiinction of cooperative society.
Student Assessment Question: Explain in a nutshell, what you think should be the attributes of a tourist's shoppers guide.
Answer to student assessment question: A tourist shopper's guide who wants to be successful in his/her business should have a first class knowledge of:  Local shops and their locations  Product range  Prices and their cultural importance in each town or city 4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit we have taken you through the various shopping attractions of tourists, traditional and modem handicraft structures in Nigeria and those that serve such institutions.
5.0 SUMMARY We hope that after reading this unit you have understood the importance as well as different ways of marketing of various crafts, handloom products and ally made different worIcs of artisans.
Starting from village and small town market, then' emporiums, exhibitions on different occasions, private shops, co-operative societies, etc., all are very useful outlets for the promotion of handicrafts.
5a KEYWORDS Antiques: An object, for example an artwork, which is valuation because it is rare, very old and has an importance to collectors.

For example, mode of transport, link transport, accommodation, meals, shopping, entertainment, etc.
A traveller who is able to manage all these by oneself is in fact one's own travel agent.
Though many may claim to be doing so but in reality there are few cases.
This is because the persOrr who has even planned or organised his own tour or travel may be lacking in information about the alternatives available.
Many more take the pains to stand in a queue or waste time.
Hence, dependence on a travel agency.
Humans have travelled since long and even depended on others for travel.
However, the concept of a travel agency in the modern sense originated in England.
The ship operators in order to market their capacity appointed agents who would help in filling the ship.
In 1729 was started the first travel agency Cox and the Kings (Thomas Cook).
This unit familiarises you with the operations of a travel agency and the basic skills required for employment there.
Ticketing, booking, cancellations, facilitation, etc are some other aspects dealt with in the unit.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you will be able to:  ICnow the role of a travel agent  Understand its various operations,  Learn in brief about ticketing, and  Appreciate the relationship between a tourist/traveller, travel Suppliers of services.
3.1 TIRAVEL AGENCY Travel agency, as the name suggests, is responsible for organising travel.
It in fact, is a travel consultant and organiser for the tourist.
At the same time it provides a link to the supplier of services with the tourists/travelers.
Hence we can say that a travel agency is like a retail store, the uniqueness being that it acts on behalf of both, the supplier as well as the clients.
For example, a tourist visits a travel agency to meet his travel demands.
The travel agency books his air tickets, arranges for his pick from the airport, books him on the hotel and so on.
Now at the surface it appears that it is only tourist who is being catered to or looked after.
However, a close look reveals that the travel agency has also served 41  the airline by booking the seat or the hotel by booking the room.
In all these services the travel agency has provided business to the supplier or service while serving the tourist at the same time.
This demonstrates the importance of the travel agency whose role is growing more and more in the modern world.
Not every traveller has the energy or time to organise all travel arrangements.
The suppliers too don't have the reach to every prospective customer.
Hence, the need for travel agency.
A travel agency also sells the package of tour operators or hotels.
Tourist / traveller Airline Railway Road Transport Hotel Facilitation Package Tour TRAVELAGENCY Before we go further to explain the various functions and operations involved there in let us look at some of the basic qualities the personnel working in a travel agency should have.
One should be:  Courteous and helpful,  Able to look at minute details  Ready to work under pressure,  Prepared to work for solving problems, and Proficient in languages etc.
Besides there are certain other factors that are also important.
For Example:  A sound lcnowledge of geography - particularly map reading and seasonality,  A fair lcnowledge of customs and practises in different countries or at the destinations one is dealing with,  Information about health, visa, permit and foreign exchange rules, 42   ICnowledge of arithmetic as fares are to be calculated or worked out,  Should Icnow typing or working on computers and  Have proficiency in communicating skills.
3.2 OPERATIONS As mentioned earlier a Travel Agency performs a number of tasks i.e.
from booking tickets to baggage insurance, facilitation etc.
Among these the primary operation starts with booking on travel modes.
This is known as ticketing.
TICKETING This is probably the most obvious and common function of a travel agency.
There are primarily two modes of transport most travel agencies do ticketing for in Nigeria.
Air travel and rail travel.
Air travel has two main departments:  Domestic tickets, and  International tickets a) Domestic Tickets: this is a term used for all travel within the country.
With the growing of the airline network, frequency and competition between airlines it is most busy department ofiany travel agency.
For Nigerian Airways, Reservations are made with proper codes and sent to Central Space Control (CSC) which through its computer confirms its status available.
With the introduction of computers terminals, reservations can be made through CRT.
This is now made available to a travel agency also who subscribes the service.
This helps in instant confirmation of Reservation status.
Through this you are regularly updated with the schedule, change of rules, changt of fare, etc.
The CRT however can reserve only 8 seats at a time and each agency has its own code and access limitation.
When ever the reservation is made a file is opened in the computer for that person or group of persons and it automatically generates a file No.
which is called PNR.
(say H43EF).
43  PNR is the only reference No.
required to check all the flights of that person or group.
F or all other Airlines the reservation is made by making a phone call to them in case they are not on the computer.
Cancellation: it is very important to know and tnake passengers aware of the cancellation rules each particular airline would apply.
SPECIAL SERVICES While malcing a reservation you could also make request for special facilities which are available for your clients' specific needs to make the journey a pleasant one.
These are:  Meal request: Vegetarian/Non Vegetarian,  Special seat assigmnent i.e.
window, front, back etc.
 Wheel chair or any other type of assistance.
 Infant crib, etc.
and  Unaccompanied minor.
REVENUE Travel Agent receives from the airlines a standard commission on the fare he sells.
In some cases for promotional reasons there is an overriding conunission tr other kind of benefits.
Many travel agencies claim service or booking charges from clients also.
INTERNATIONAL TICKETING All travel intemationally is tlealt within this department.
Because of the enotmous number of cities and airlines involved along with countries the working is more complex.
Yet, the basic procedures and steps remain the same.
For rail bookings also it is must to know the railway time table and procedure to book tickets.
Student exercise H: why is it necessary to malce a passenger aware of cancellation rules?
44  3.3 FACILITATION Facilitation is a service available to a traveller by the travel agency to facilitate his travel.
This is an important part of a travel agency which it offers generally as a courtesy service or for a nominal fee.
Passport: this is the most important document to travel abroad.
The agency helps the traveller with obtaining proper forms and submit it to the passport office on behalf of the client as well as receive it from that office.
Also, it is important to check if.
 There is an old passport  It is still valid, and  More pages are required for stamping in VISA of different countries.
2.
Visa: After obtaining passport, a visa from each country of visit needs to be obtained to travel.
Assistance of submission and a collection of papers is done by the travel agency.
But quite often some countries wish for a private interview with the traveller.
3.
Health: travel agency needs to advise the traveller of the health regulations for travel such as requirement of Cholera inoculation, yellow fever, etc.
it should give guidelines of what precautions to talce while travelling and whether insurance is advisable.
4.
Insurance: Travel ,insurance especially for health is available in some countries for overseas travel and in some countries like Germany it is mandatory to have such insurance for the period of their stay.
5.
Customs: each country has it own customs regulations and allows restricted quantity of items to be brought or taken along with personal baggage.
The agency should inform its clients on the customs regulations especially of ones own country and some important features of other countries.
6.
Immigration: this is responsible to check and endorse final permission for the passenger to leave or enter the country.
In Nigeria one of the important check is the endorsement on the passport.
7.
Permits: There are areas where your client will be visiting.
It is the Agent's.
responsibility to find out if he requires any special permission to visit the area.
45  8.
Baggage: the customer must be told in advance how much baggage can be carried free and the charges for excessive baggage.
He should also know what items are not allowed in hand baggage.
The procedures to be followed for baggage security checks like X-ray, baggage identification etc.
should also be told - particularly to die first time traveller.
9.
Airport: as the air traffic has grown, some cities may have more then one ternrinals or airports.
It is important that the agents inform the passenger which terminal or airport to go to and which terminal or airport he will land.
It is important to know what airport facilities are available at the airports so drat passengers could avail of them.
For example:  arrival and departure of the journey  check in counters  departure hall arrival hall and baggage receiving area pre-paid taxi service bus: airport to city many choices like non air-conditioned and air- conditioned air-conditioned public area tourist infonnation counters ticketing counters for domestic flights Public phone with STD and ISD facilities.
(Free local phone at international departure and arrival lounge )  Lounge  Cafeteria  Restaurant - Toilets  toilets for handicapped  shops — boolcs  doctor and first aid  baby feeding  children's comer  left baggage  police security check  duty free shops  mishandled baggage wheel chair VIP lounge  Dinner club lounge Airport manager - Porters  Luggage trolley ADDMONAL RESPONSIBILITIES  Railway reservations - Airline reservations Travel agencies have to be very careful in choosing or going for the suppliers.
This is because they are responsible to the clients where as they have no control once a joumey has started'.
There are chances of suppliers errors being attributed to them.
Hence, there has to be an honest representation of the supplier's services at the time of sales.
The client should also be provided with all relevant information regarding visa, customs etc.
and to provide such services the travel agency has to update the lcnowledge and information regarding the services and tourism products from various sources.
Taking of FAM trips in this regard is Very useful.
At the same time Travel Agency have to do their own marketing and promotions for attracting more and more clients.
4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you're read about the role of a travel agent, its various operations, you're also leamt about ticketing and the relationship between a tourist and a traveller and supplier of services.
5.0 SUMMARY  Travel agency is not only a crucial link between the tourist/traveller and suppliers of tourism services but it also plays a vital role in destination promotion.
 A first hand knowledge or experience of services is always good for the travel agent.
47   Certain basic skills are necessary to those who may take jobs in travel ageneies.

Generally people conftise the travel agency with tour operator.
However a close look into their roles and fimctions reveals that they have different roles to play.
In some cases travel agencies also work as or offer the services of tour operators.
But again it is the ftinctions from which we distinguish the two and in case a travel agency is doing so we may say it is also performing the role of a tour operator.
This unit attempts to familiarize you with the functions of a tour operator along with the basic knowledge and requirements handle such function.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you will be able to:  ICnow the definition of tour operator,  Understand what all is included in tour operating,  Leam about the role of wholesaler and retailers in this area,  Identify the main partners in the planning and costing of a tour, and  Have an idea of tourist transport operators, 3.1, TOUR OPERATOR You must have seen advertisements in the newspapers or magazines Three day or one week tour that mentions the total price of the tour along with the itinerary.
These are the offers of package tour which are available to individuals as well as groups.
But have you ever paid attention to this that who pacicages such tours and why?
Or how they are packaged and marketed?
Well many individuals work out their own details of travel and pleasure.
But this is a time consuming process.
There are many who don't want to bother themselves about planning and organizing their journeys, stay etc.
rather they want this to be done by some one else.
It is precisely this demand that led to the origin of package tour includes travels (air/ surface} , accommodation, escort/ guide and so on.
The person who puts together all these aspects into a package is known as the tour operator.
In other words we can say that tour operator is a person who provides information, plans and coordinates travel with various agencies to create a package or service.
At the same time he also ensures smooth operation of the tour.
He can thus, also be called a tour/ travel consultant or tour coordinator.
The tour operator may not necessarily have any product of his own but act as an intermediary to tailor package to meet the needs of a traveler.
In fact, a tour operator plays an important role in 50  organizing explorations, research expeditions and holidays.
We must remember here that tour operations originated ever since people wanted to explore new areas, go on pilgrimage or trade expeditions, individually or in groups.
However, in the modern sense tour operation involves: 1) Information of the area of operation i.e.
in — depth knowledge of the Places of interest, the accommodation, transport facilities and other Logistics required for planning a tour.
2) Planning of a tour in the most efficient manner.
3) Coordination with allied industries or services such as hotel reservations, airline, rail or road transport reservations.
Local assistance, guides, etc.
4) Operation of tour mean a close monitoring of the tour i.e.
all that is packaged together is working in smooth coordination.
In case of break in the circuit an alternate is to be organized with lease inconvenience to the client.
This is another vital segment in the planning and operation of a tour.
There are different kinds of operators, these could be: i) individual/independent tour operator, ii) a travel agency which also functions as tour operator, iii) in house tour operators like an airlines doing the functions of tour operator also, iv) incentive travel agencies who deal only with the sponsors and not with individual clients.
There are three broad classifications of tour operators according to the functions performed.
1) Inbound: who handles tours coming into the country from overseas Is called an inbound tour operator.
2) Outbound: who operates tours to other countries is called an out Bound tour operator.
Domestic: who handles tours of people of same country for travel Within the country is called a domestic tour operator.
51  It is not necessary that these have to be separate or one does operate the types.
But it is seen that since the market and the style of operations in each one are distinctly different then the other operators prefer to stay in their own specialized field.
However one agency can be all three of any two of the operations.
In each of the above classifications there are two categories: 1.
Wholesaler: who plans the tour, puts a package and markets the tour.
2.
Retailer: who sells the tour to the passenger.
He is normally the personal travel agent with whom the client is buying other services such as tickets, facilitation of passports and visa etc.
The retailer is the coordinator between the wholesaler and the client.
This is in turn passed to the operator side as follows: 1) Inbound tour operator: the wholesaler who markets the tour Consolidates the members of the group through many retailers.
Finally the group thus formed is given by the wholesaler as a package to inbound operator of that country or that region.
The coordination of Icotels, transport and other allied services is then done by the inbound operator.
2) Excursion agents: inbound tour operators fiirther pass on the services of the group to some body in the city of visit.
This somebody is known as the excursion agent who in turn, coordinates with hotel reservations, organises transport and guides and generally meets the needs of the tourist in that city.
Example One person in USA want to visit Nigeria or South Africa but does not know how to go about it .
He walk in the travel agency which he normally uses or thinks that it can help him.
He meets the travel consular who talks to him arid finds out his interest, the time he could spend for travel, the tour he could afford, the luxury he is loolcing for and the season of travel.
The wholesaler collects people from all over the country and forms a group.
Message of this with names, itinerary and flight details etc.
is sent to an inbound tour operator who has organised reservations for hotel, transport and other services all 52  over the country.
This inbound tour operator then gives message to excursion agents in each city of visit about the groups strength, arrived, arrived and departure details and request for services to be arranged in that city.
The excursion agents are normally requested to provide: 1) Receiving the group at the airport and taking them to the hotel and vice versa.
2) Provide appropriate transport for the group to travel in the area.
3) Provide guide for entrance fee at places of visit.
4) Provide tickets for the group.
5) Any special services for the group.
6) Reconfirm hotel reservations.
7) Reconfirm onward flight/ train/bus reservation confirmation.
And so the group moves from one excursion agent to another while the inbound tour operator is closely monitoriag the movement being the chief coordinator.
This way an inbound tour operator is able to provide pickup service and transport and excursions at each city in Nigeria for example even though he does not have an office in more than one city.
Tourist Wholesaler Inbound Excursion Retailer Tour Agent Operator At the same time there are different categories of package tours: 1.
Escorted Tours.
this is an organized and planned tour in which a tour escort serves the group or individual by accompanying throughout the tour.
2.
Unescorted Tours: though organized and planned , in this tour there is no escort accompanying the tour.
Instead the group or individual is taken care of at every destination by tour host/ excursion agent whose services have been taken for that particular destination.
53  3.2 IVIAIN PARTNERS The main partners in tour operations are: Hotel/Accommodation industry Transport industry A tour operator must know the details about these two.
HOTEL/ACCO1VIMODATION INDUSTRY Most group movement in some countries of the world of foreign tourists is done on star category hotels The hotel have a star rating from the department of tourism, govermnent of such country.
This helps in ascertaining the quality of hotel expected.
There are following categories of star rated hotels.
1 star 2 star 3 star 4 star 5 star deluxe Hotel have various worldng codes.
These are referred to in packages designed for the consumers: 3.3 PACKAGE TOURS A protram developed to cater to a group of people traveling together for a Pthticularjoumey which involves hotels and transport arrangements and May also involve visits to places, guides special meeting and functions is Called a pacicage tour.
Package tours are also defined through their: Destination, and Interest.
Among the destinations would be: 1) Single comitry tour 2) Area tour i.e.
visiting more than one country.
3) Two city tour 4) Single city tour, etc.
At present most visitors to Nigeria do visit some of the national parks, Osun' Osogbo that are already popular and well developed.
54  Another very important aspect of tourism now is sport tours.
Golf tours are being promoted very enthusiastically, while there are others like polo and car racing, which are also coming up.
Tours are also being packaged to coincide with sports events such as Cricket, Hockey and Football matches.
This is another very popular form of tourism that is coming up.
A similar situation is in relation to fairs and festivals as primary or secondary attractions.
Quite often companies offer incentive to their dealers or employees such as additional payments, gifts of some kind or a holiday.
The holiday incentive is becoming increasingly popular.
This is often a large group movement which vary from 10 to 500 persons.
Known as incentive tours, they are normally of short duration but expensive.
In such tours special attention needs to be paid on:  Size of movement,  Cuisine,  Theme parties,  Gifts,  Baggage handling, and  Promotion and information material.
Whenever thee is a conference in a country it brings large number of people together (convention tourism).
ThiSitquires organization with special slcills.
Tours operators assist in:  Marketing a conference,  Conference secretarial help,  Transports,  Pre and post conference tours,  Special events,  Size of volunteer forces,  Entertainment,  C.onference facilitation like registration, interpreters, etc.
Some tour operators also charter aircraft to bring in tourist from a country.
The fares of the charters are low which enable many people who are not able to afford expensive air tickets on scheduled airline to travel.
The charter is large volume travel and requires hotel, transport and tours commencing from charter destination.
There are luxury cruises that travel around the world or in some part of the tour.
55  They are normally expensive, demanding high quality and high volume.
Student Exercise II: mention some of the incentive tours of which special attention needs to be paid for.
3.4 PLANNING TOUR For tour operator, while wrtrking on a tour programme, it is important to consider the following matters: 1 Interest: interest of the person for whom you are planning the tour is most important — planner must know if the theme is sightseeing, cultural, religious, historical, architectural, wildlife, adventure spot or leisure, etc.
3.
Time of visit: when the person wishes to visit.
This is important for season, flights, tariffs etc.
4.
Pace: this is important as different nationalities and different age groups like to move differently.
Some like to spend one day at each place while others like to spend two to three days or even more.
5.
Budget: this is important as this will determine the quality of hotels, the amount of travel and activity and other variables - meals, special party, theater or shows, special visits etc.
Once we know the above parameters we need to find out: 1.
The proposed points of visit, their location and accessibility by road, train and flights.
2.
Facilities available i.e.
types of hotels, local transport, local agent, telephones, etc.
3.Entrance formalities and other rules.
4.
Any permits if require and who will issue and what are the requirements.
5.
Any holidays during the period of the tour.
Since it may happen that the place of visit may be closed on that day tour.
6.
Fair and festivals: this always adds to increasing the possibility of value to the 56  7. any special event taldng place which can be included to enhance the usefulness of the visit like book fair, or a special crafts display.
8.
About the time of operation: i.e.
what is the season and any problems with it such as heart, snow, floods etc.
One should also see if accessibility is there because, for example a few important national parks are closed for three to five months in a year when visibility is poor.
9.
The time taken to travels: It is variable depending on the road conditions.
The type of transport will also determine the travel time since bus is 20 to 25 percent slower.
10.
The time required to visit a monument, Yankari national park or a particular event, and the timings.
11.
The availability of guides and what languages can they speak.
12.
The details of shopping, etc.
Here we give you an example of planning a package tour.
Nature Package tour Interest and Forts and palaces Age-group 30 — 40 Budget H i g h Time and Season October (winter; peak season for touism) Number Ten Duration One week (10 to 17 October) Abuja and Jos and Bauchi Visiting points/ Destinations Pace 2 days each Modes of transport mini luxurious bus Permits Nil Holiday N i l Hotel range 5 to 3 stars Coach AC.
Deluxe at destinations Guides Local at destination Shopping Open Entertainment Local cultural dancers/performancers M e a l p l a n s Special event Visit to the national assembly in session.
57  After this exercise the next step is to look for information on these aspects.
For example, flight timings, availability of guides, coaches, accommodation etc.
now make the itinerary for each day taking the one above as an example.
3.5 COSTINGATOUR For everyone who is buying a tour, it is important what the cost is going to be.
Similarly for a tour operator, it is important to analyse how much profit can be made over the cost.
The cost will depend on:  Duration of the tour.
 Transport type - air conditioned or non air conditioned, cars, jeeps, mini coach or large coach, charter of boat or seat in a boat etc., air travel or train travel.
 Number of persons traveling together.
 Category of hotels required.
 Types.
of rooms required.
 Tylies of service required, all meals or part of meals.
 Excursions and sightseeing required.
 Time of operations - change of tariff, peak season or off season rates will be applicable.
 Guides and their allowances and expenses.
A tour operator takes one to two years to plan and organize the product.
He also takes risks in this regard by making advance bookings and reservations to ensure availability.
In case there are no takers the tour operator suffers heavy losses.
3.6 MARKETINGMATERIAL A tour operator has to prepare marketing material for selling the product.
This has to be well thought and carefully planned.
This will reflect the image of the company and your professionalism.
This is done in various ways:  Providing updated information on the destination,  Preparing good itineraries,  Manuals and other reference materials of help,  Printing tour brochures and confidential tariffs,  Time tables,  Video cassettes,  Slide presentations, 58   Special shows,  Familiarization visit.
One has to correspond with prospective clients or sponsor of group tours.
3.7 TOURIST TRANSPORT OPERATION Tourist transport is a very integral part of the tourism industry.
It is important to see that the transport is dependable, clean, in good condition and the driver is courteous, punctual, lcnowledgeable of the route and a safe driver.
As mentioned already, there are mainly two categories of transport - cars and coaches.
There are many sizes of coaches and selection will depend on the purpose and area of operation which may vary.
The bus transport is for long journey for those who can afford a good holiday and are looking for:  Comfortable luxury seats possibly reclaiming,  ' Air-conditioned/non- air-conditioned.
 Video  Facilities for drinlcs, fruits etc.
 Toilets  Baggage space - the luggage compartment should be large enough to the baggage or there should be a good rack on the bus.
 Hat rack and seat pocket are also very important to keep hand baggage, jackets and reading materials.
It is for this reason that this bus is termed as a deluxe coach and not a bus.
Here one must remember that whatever facilities are offered in the coach they must be functional like fan, bell, lights etc.
Tourist transport is mostly a full charter and does not allow sharing with others.
Many tour operators have their own coaches but many hire them also from the transport operators.
In fact tourist transport operators have emerged as another vital component of the tourism industry.

It is only recently, since tourism has come to be recognised as a great economic asset that some slight recognition has come to them.
However, the traditional mould in which guides and escorts were cast might take a little time in freeing itself for setting pace along with the growth of tourism.
This unit aims to be a small effort in this direction.
We have described the role of guides and escorts and discussed some modem technique pertaining to successful professional guiding.
As a professional involved with tourism we recommend the issues discussed in the unit to be the minimum standards of competence in the field of guiding or escorting a tour.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you will be able to:  ICnow the definitions of a guide and a tour escort, Understand the difference between them,  Get details about different type of guides and their roles, .
Learn the teclufiques of guiding, and  Understand the details of escorting a tour.
3.1 DEFINING GUIlThES AND ESCORTS No sooner do we speak of guides, the wrinlded face of a man who would mingle a lot of fables with few historical facts begins to emerge.
Almost all of us, the tourists and the professionals in the business of tourism, have come to form a stereotype image of the guides, irrespective of the fact that guiding and escorting tours are highly professional business and require acquisition of special skills for suOdessful careers.
We have ventured to break these stereotypes by defining guides and escorts in the context of modern day demands of the tourism system.
A careful pentsal of following aspects will help you evolve the role of a professional competent guide or an escort for yourself.
WHO AN ESCORT?
The scope of an escort's terrain and expertise also varies considerably.
Depending upon the nature of the tour, an escort is supposed to perform the roie of an accompanying manager to a subject expert.
He may escort the tour to a: 63   Specific piece of art  Rural area  Geographical region  Historical site,  Metropolitan area, and  Business, etc.
The role of an escort begins as soon as the tourist/arrive/s at his place.
It ends only with the departure of the tourist.
So during the stay of the tourists an escort may get a few intermissions, but unlike a guide, he may not be free from iris responsibilities throughout the duration of the tourist stay.
In escorted tours the job also involves loolcing after facilitation, aspects like getting the custom clearances done or check in etc.
at the airnorts.
In fact an escort is responsible for the entire group during the journey and at the destination.
TOURIST EXPECTATIONS The knowledge of tourist group expectations from its guide/escort is an extremely helpful tool in charting your own course of action.
In fact you must do an exercise on profiling the tourist soon after their arrival.
Two main areas in this regard which deserve your attention are the tourists ' demands for:  Developing an awareness and understanding of the area they are visiting, and  Efficient and responsible management of their programme.
The tourists demand from their guides or escorts accuracy with regard to the knowledge of facts, astuteness, to deal with tricky situations and sympathy with regard to their own problems, however trifle in nature they may be.
You should, therefore, be particularly thorough with facts, resourceful and full of understanding for the demands and problems of the tourist.
3.2 ROLE OF THE GUIDE The role of the guide, as it is perceived today, has a histoty.
It is in fact a mixture of two different roles viz of the one who would traditionally lead the way on an unlcnown terrain and an advisor on any lcind of travel.
The two roles do not always harmonize yet exist in a guide in varying proportions today.
In the context of our own country Nigeria we can say that the two are complimentary.
64 •  LOCATION Examples and illustrations you will read in this subsection are what happens in Nigeria, which invariably happens in most countries with some other placies.
Tourism in Nigeria, and the practitioners are at the infant stage so a guide is a guide for all aspects of tourism.
As we grow and develop there would definitely be variation in specialisation.
An example of a museum with a good guide is that of the slave trade museum in Badagry, Lagos State.
Location guides are the leaders that take the tourist into hitherto unknown partially known terrain Since the nature of the terrains differs widely, the guide role also varies.
Depending upon the setting, the tourists and their purpose of visit we can categorise location guides in India under several heads.
Here we have selected the three most common types for detailed description.
Monuments: the most commonly found guides are those who specialize in describing the monumental heritage of any country.
As a matter of fact guides available at these monuments have come to project a particular perception of the guides.
Most of those guides lack a proper historical understanding of the architectural wealth of the region where they operate.
It will suffice here to list the abilities of such a guide:  The foremost in this list is obviously the requirement of adequate knowledge of the history of the region so as to able to describe the monument in perspective,  The guide should be well versed with the stylistic and architectural details of the monuments.
 All historical facts about the monuments such as the date of its construction, the agency responsibility for construction, time taken, design and arichitect, the purpose of the monument, etc.
should be known to the guide.
 The guide should be able to sift fables from history: though it is not suggested that the anecdotal details should be rejected, they can certainly be kept at deep discount.
 The guide should not construct history on one's own absence of firm evidence 65  Museums: museum is a fantastic place for a guide to describe.
It is here that the role of the guide, both as educator and as entertainer, comes to fruition.
As a tourist guide or otherwise also when you take visitors to a museum, it is important for you to know the variety and the range of the collections housed there.
This information is of immense help to you in catering to the tourist who may not have common taste for all things kept in the museum.
On the contrary, it is most often the case that there are some many different interests in a group of tourist as their actual count.
In such situations the variety and the range of your lcnowledge regarding the exhibits of a museum will stand you in good stead.
You will also find this information handy in deciding to curtail or extend the visit of the group to a museum and may at times reap rich dividends if you succeed in evolcing the appreciation of the tourist for the varieties and the artistic merit of the exhibits.
We shall therefore insist that you:  Collect detailed information about the museum,  Arrange this information to convenient categories,  Occasionally sift your information, and  Regularly update this information, Besides when you guide visitors to a museum you should:  Make sure how much time the visitor has to spend there and .
 The area of interest.
Accordingly you can adjust your conunentary on exhibits and decide what to show, gloss over or give a passing reference only.
WILDLIFE Wildlife touristn is potentially one of the most viable and economically rewarding area of tourism.
Hence, it is imperative on a tourism pmfessional and more so on a wildlife guide or escort to understand its intricacies and use this information to his/her advantages.
Most of the tourist visiting a wildlife area are innocent and therefore willing to learn from you and follow your instructions.
Unlike several other situations, as a wildlife guide or escort you are located in an enviably privileged position.
But this simultaneously entails upon you the additional responsibility of being thoroughly familiar with the peculiar features of wildlife tourism.
66  CITY TOUR Chu following aspects :1 •c, to be considered: You must profile the group of tourists who are intending to visit the wildlife preserve by reading carefully: a. their purpose of travel (i.e.
recreation, relaxation, study of nature, etc) and b. the behavioural characteristics of the tourists.
You should understand the following problems areas in wildlife tourism: a. timing- the preserves are open during day hours only thereby eliminating all possibilities of evening or night watch of the animals.
b. accessibility - not many places are easily accessible nor are there adequate preparations made.
The two more important aspects on which we would like you to pay greater attentions are in the commentary for the tour, and useful material and travel tips to be given to the tourist.
Now that everything is ready, the coach departs.
Here you must remember that:  The length of the trip should not be very taxing physically  There should be adequate stops during the trip  Sufficient time should be made available for shopping and,  You must take care of a few problem spots such as sudden illness to the tourist, loss of luggage/passport/money, and missing tour members.
3.3 GLIDING AS A TECHNIQUE In modem day tourism the job of guiding is a technique.
You should acquire the slcill in conformity with your specific requirements.
In the following sub-sections we shall deal with the general trails of the technique.
LEADERSHIP It has been rightly said by 'Cathleen Pond: "most people have a fairly well defined image of the ideal tour guide: outgoing, affable, well informed, enthusiastic.
Certagily the best guides are an eclectic composite of these positive personality traits".
You will appreciate that all the personality limits stated above suggest one specific feature - the leadership quality.
This is one of the most effective social limit a guide must possess to become successful in his trade.
Leadership requires: 67   Enthusiasm,  Self-confidence,  Proactive nature,  Sensitivity,  Flexibility,  Decisiveness,and  Sense of humour.
Some of these traits are natural gifts, but most can be acquired as skills.
We would like to emphasize that the traits listed here do not lend themselves to any kind of measure.
They can be acquired with practice.
A judicious mix of these traits in any individual's personality is purely a personal matter.
FACTUAL KNOWLEDGE Knowledge of a wide array of subjects is absolutely essential for the persons involved in guiding the tours.
However, subject matters differ from guides from region to region.
Therefore local educational programmes should be paid careful attention."
Some of the common areas, the knowledge about which cannot be ignored by any guide, are:  Geography and topography  History, culture and religion,  Folklore,  Economy and industry,  Travel and tourism, and It can be said that a guide is in fact a representative of the place chooses to work.
He should, therefore, be culturally literate because tourists can ask a guide questions about several related or even unrelated aspects of the region of their visit.
It should be emphasized here that authenticity of information passed on to the tourists by the guide is the key factor in the success of his career.
Most tourists are instinctively drawn to and trust guides who are genuine and who have an honest, open aura about them.
PRESENTATION A guide has only two basic tools to vvork with in his prothssion - the voice and the body language.
It is therefore essential that the presentation skill of the guide is tuned perfectly.
Presentation can also be an engaging and enjoyable 68  experience.
Since presentation by a guide is a simpler affair than lecturing, it contains enormous possibilities for effective and captivating communication.
People want to listen to you if you are:  Lively and delightful,  Vivid in descriptions,  Simple with language, and  Comfortable with the audience and the topic.
Since body is a very powerful communicator and has a language of its ovvn, it is imperative upon you to pay careful attention to the posture and movement of your hands as well as features and the eye contact.
Your presentation must make the listener believe that what they hear is what they see.
In the kind of presentation a guide offers, voice plays a very crucial role in making it convincing and impressive.
"The voice" writes Kathleen Pond, "is the speaker's most valuable commodity and, like a musical instrument, it must be cared for and kept in tune".
You must remember that the tourist would often listen to your voice for eight or more hours a day.
Student exercise II: explain the role of a location guide working at a historical site.
3.4 ESCORTING A TOUR Escorting a tour involves careful preparation and planning.
The escort has also to keep himself ready for special situations that may arise from unforeseen circumstances.
We shall discuss each of these aspects separately in the following sub-sections.
PLANNING Planning has today become almost a scientific operation.
The tour escort should know:  The rate of success with similar tours in the past.
 How to broaden the scope of the tour with the.
help of the experiences gathered by others, and  The problem areas of the tour to workout the remedies.
It needs to be emphasised that while planning a tour the escort must live the tour day by day.
He should take special care of the following areas.
69  Schedh%ng: a is a combinai ion of flit:tots vvith some uncertain variables. )
The central idea is to look for the right place, at the right time, for the right people and at a right price.
Events: the events to be covered on a tour should be so planned as to suit the taste of most of the tourist.
No event should offend anyone.
All the events should keep cost factor into focus.
iii) Variables: weather, unforeseen occurrences, transport upsets are some important variables which must find a place in tour planning.
This will enable you to keep alternatives handy and save the tour.
PREPARATION Advance preparation is an essential feature of successful escorting.
You must:  Know what information is needed in connection with the tour and where to get that,  Understand what items become part of your preparations for the tour and how to obtain them,  Appreciate the needs of the tour members and how best to meet them, an  ICnow what basic information needs to be supplied to tour members.
All successful tours tell the same story i.e.
good preparation.
As an instance you may pay attention to the follovving details at the preparatory stage:  Checklists: travel checklists are a very useful tool to your successful preparation.
You may not forget even the smallest item/detail pertaining to the tour.
 Tour itinerary: we emphasize that you mentally tour for entire route/place and plan all possible events in scrupulous details.
 Commentary: this is a very important, (though most often neglected) aspect of escorting the tour.
A crisp, informative, delightful commentary punctuated with humour is a sure key to the success of the tour.
 Travel tips: vital for tour party.
It must contain those little tips which can make or mar the tour.
The tourists are appreciative of such help and their gratitude is your final reward.
70  S PECI AL SI T U AT I ON S The tour escort should invariably have the energy and courage to cope with special situations.
Some of the more frequently encountered -situation" are:  Loss of money and passport: the most common complaint.
We advice you keep everyone's passport deposited under your custody for the duration of the tour.
Also advise them not to carry too much cash with their person and transfer most of the business in traveler cheques or credit cards, if they have access to such a facility.
 Sickness.
warn the tourist against eating at sundry places, drinking unclean water and weather vagaries such as a heartstroke during hot/dry season (summers) or exposure to cold during the winters.
 Missing tour member: take care that the tourist adhere to the schedule.
You have to be persuasive and at times stern too.
But under no situation should you I lose your cool.
Self Assessment questions: 1 .Give the definition of a).

4.0 CONCLUSION In this unit, you've read about Guides and Escorts.
You ought to have understood the meaning and definition of guides and tour escorts, their techniques of guiding and details of escortings a tour.
71  5.0 SUMMARY  Guiding and escorting are the most exciting features of tourism profession.
These are the roles that are truly the soul of the tour.
 Guides and escorts are in fact an amalgam of several independent roles.
Thus while they retain a part of these individual roles such as that of an entertainment, an educator, or even a public relations man of their region/place, they are never to be stereotyped into anyone exclusively.
 They retain an independent identity of their own.
 It is this identity that makes them such lively and delightful person in the perceptions of the tourist.
5a Key words Enthusiastic: full of energy and will to learn.
Fascinating: attractive Stereotyped: typical Terrain: Geographical landscape Wrinkled face: weather-beaten face.
6.0 Tutor Marked Assignments: it has been said that wildlife tourism is potentially one of the most viable and economically rewarding area of tourism.

A variety of questions are posed like where did you stay?
Which airlines you traveled with?
Was the service better than the other?
etc.
But liere , .
rethember that the answers coming bnek are that of an individual's experiences.
It is possible drat this individual was not aware of the options available or in other words access to limited information only.
Yet oral communication remains the initial information seeging channel.
However, tourism services and operations are specialised skills.
It is therefore, imperative on a professional working in the tonrism industry to acquire knowledge and information in as many diverse forms as is possible.
We cannot overemphasize the significance of information as a sure ingredient of success in tourism industry.
This unit is intended as a guide for the beginner and a more experienced hand in tourism industry as to the possible sources of infOrmation pertaining to tourism.
The learner, with a little bit of practice, will surely be able to grasp the technique of culling similar information form a score of other sources.
2.0 OBJECTIVES After reading this unit you should be able to:  Have a general idea of the importance of infOrination on tourism for a professional,  Possess details_of the main government agencies which provide tourism related information,  ICnow about the private agencies as sources oftourism information, and  Learn to look for such information at appropriate plibes in the print media.
3.1 IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION There may be ample illustrations to suggest that collecting and possessin4 iVormation is vital for a successful career in tourism.
We cite for you some priority areas below: PLANNING Planning is the backbone of tourism services and operations, even when you have to repeat the operations year after year, there has to be fresh input of planning each year.
In fact a four-pronged strategy for planning seems to work well.
The elements of this strategy are: 74   Retrospective analysis,  Current perceptions,  Introspective analysis and  Futuristic vision.
In each case a sufficient information base becomes an inevitability.
Moreover, a thorough overhaul of this information at periodic intervals becomes another necessity.
This calls for a specific consideration to information collection from as varied sources as one can actually tap.
MANAGEMENT Management is the life of tourism industry.
It is at this level that a tour can make or break.
"Admirable management" is the most common accolades won for a tour.
Besides training, therefore, it is the different kinds of information input that tourism professionals in the job of managing the tours most urgently require.
Some major heads under which information is mostly needed while managing tours are:  Kinds of tour packages available,  Different modes of travel that can be affanged,  Types of accommodation,  ICnowledge of the destination area, and  Kinds of ancillary service that can be procured.
It is most desirable that a variety of information on these subjects is collected by the tourism professionals.
A successful management of the tours hinges, rather heavily, on the availability of this information.
PROMOTION Promotion is what sells the tour.
The central objective of all promotional effort is to inform, interest and involvement may be generated by stuffing the tourist with interesting, attractive and useful information.
Some of the more common and often repeated methods of promotion are:  Presentations - introductory in nature and essentially aimed at providing information, 75   Publicity - a more vigorous promotion, with the help of detailed information, and  Advertising 4 providing specialized information with promotional mix.
You would notice that the common denominator in all these is "information".
The role of information (from different sources) is thus central to all the services and operations pertaining to tourism.
Student exercise 1: mention and explain some of the common and often repeated methods of promotion.
3.2 SOURCES OF INFORNIATION: GOVERNMENT AGENCIES In Nigeria, government is the largest sources of tourism related information.
Through varipus agencies and at several levels, often overlapping, the government, both at the centre and in the states generates information that is directly relevant to the tourism industry in the country.
We have discussed below the main agencies, which are the most potent sources of tourism information.
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF CULTURE & TOURISM Since tourism industry is one of the biggest foreign exchange earners, the government at the centre has a department of tourism to oversee the planning developing, promotion and administration of tourism in the country.
At present the department generates and disseminates tourism related information at three levels, viz plarming, promotion and development.
Besides the domestic tourists, the department also caters to a large number of foreign tourists.
For this reason the information disseminated by the department has a substantial content geared almost exclusively at attracting foreign tourism.
The main categories under which the information is available with the Federal Ministry of tourism and NTDC are: 5) Compilation and Collection: several kinds of posters, booklets, pamphlets and leaflets are printed after collecting information from different organisations etc.
They contain thematic as well as destinational information.
6) Enquires: attending to the specific enquires of domestic and international tourists regarding tourism in Nigeria like a booklet on hotel tariffs.
76  7) Geographical and Topographical: tourist guide map of individual towns as well as zonal/regional maps showing the site/s accessibility and accommodation.
8) Facilitation: such as simplifying the procedural formalities for international tourists; regulations, etc.
9) Visuals: photographic and video documentation of heritage etc.
for tourism purposes.
10) Data base: in respect of statistics and market research on domestic and international tourist traffic.
Some of these items are given free of cot whereas others are priced.
You should now be able to select the category of your interest and use and obtain relevant information from the Federal Ministry of tourism or NTDC.
NIGERIAN TOURISM DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION Since its inception the corporation has been involved in diverse kind of operations.
These include: Transport: travels & tours, Publicity services, Entertainment: cultural displays at workshops and seminars Conferences Management Consultancy: in collaboration with state government, etc.
On each of these activities the corporation generates information in the form of brochures, pamphlets and leaflets.
It also uses visual media and produces videocassettes on all above activities.
STATE TOURISM COMMITTEES (VVhere they exist) The state tourism committees and state tourism development corporations usually attached to ministry of Commerce have been set up by same state governments.
Yet the level of tourism development in the states has been uneven.
Whereas the states like Lagos, Plateau, Rivers and Nassarawa have made rapid advances, there are states like Cross Rivers Tourism information, Ogun, Ekiti and Kogi where tourism development has to be geared up.
77  In the generation of information, most states have emulated the Federal Ministry of Culture and NTDC.
You may, therefore, eXpect to get similar information, with focus on respective state, from the tourism offices of state governments.
Student exercise II: Find out from the tourism committee of your local government area, their activities concerning tourism development.
3.3 SOURCES OF INFORNIATION: PRIVATE AGENCIES Private agencies have, over the years, acquired a greater share in tourism development and promotion in the country.
We discuss them below: TOUR OPERATORS Tour operators are intended at basically packaging or managing a tour.
The promotional activities were, in the beginning, ancillary in nature.
However, of late, the tour operators have information which would help and benefit their clients.
The main categories of such information are given below:  Tourist Attraction: the tour operators like the Federal Ministry of Tourism and state tourism department issue brochures on main tourist attractions in Nigeria however, each one of them confines to the area or interest on which he is doing business.
The popularity of it is the direct result of this lcind of Promotion.
FTAN (Federation of tourism Associations of Nigeria) is the direct result of this kind of promotion.
 Boarding and Lodging: accommodation and catering in the next inain concern.
You will, therefore, find an equally large number of brochures, servicing the purpose of a hotel and restaurant guide, flooding the hotel display center.
Publishes every year the Hotel and Restaurant guide ofNigeria this is the most informative source in the area.
 Shopping: tour operators also promote the crafts of Nigeria in a big way.
You will thus fmd a large number of brochures describing the craft traditions of Nigeria.
HOTEL INDUSTRY There are some hotels in the country which sell package tours to both the domestic as well as intemational tourists.
The information generated thus includes the following details of the area: 78   Historical attractions,  Craft attraction,  Cuisine,  Room tariffs and services available, etc.
In many cases the information is just a duplication of the one available in the brochures issued by the Federal Ministry of Tourism or by tour operators.
But sometimes you may come across a new and genuine piece of information.
We therefore, advice that for your area, try to scan through the information available from the hotel industry and keep safely the new, valuable information.
3.4 SOURCES OF INFORMATION: MEDIA As a source of information the print/other media generally serves the purpose of addendum.
The main categories of print media information have been discussed below.
NEWSPAPERS, 1VIAGAZINES AND ADVERTISEMENTS The newspapers and magazines have today started publishing tourism related information in a big way.
In almost all the national dailies and especially every Wednesday/Friday Tribune and Friday Vanguard, important magazines and in the regional language newspapers there is periodic reporting of special supplements on tourism.
They contain information on the general and specific destinations under the following heads:  History  Geography and topography  Craft traditions  Accessibility and accommodation  Cuisine and catering, etc.
Most of these write ups are today done by reputed travellers/tourism experts, journalist tourism expert writers, and should therefore be preserved by you.
Advertisements are an important source of information in tourism.
They tell you about tariffs, off season discounts, tour packages, types of acommodation, view resorts, airline schedules and fares, etc.
79  SPECIALIZED PUBLICATIONS With the promotion of tourism as an important industry there have begun appearing specialised monographs on various aspects of tourism.
These can be categorised as under:  Travel and Tourism definitions  Tourism management  Culture tourism  Wildlife tourism  Island and beach tourism  Desert safaris  Hill resorts  Adventure tourism etc.
Some of these publications are a hotchpotch of information gathered from random sources.
They should be discarded.
But other books are Understanding Tourism in Nigeria and "Tourism Management" are a good themes pertaining to the tourism studies.
You must select, from among several titles, the boolcs you find as easy and intelligible reading.
This will update yolt knowledge and help you in evolving new skills pertaining to your profession.
NON-PRINT MEDIA Today TV serials, sponsored programmes, films, commercials, documentaries, promotional films etc.
are importatd sources of information in tourism.
With the help of video films one can show the tourists the type of services available or one can have a look at the quality and size of rooms in a hotel before packaging them in the tour and so on.
In fact non-print media is fast picking up.
STORING OF INFORMATION An important aspect here is that how do you store the information that you have collected from various sources.
Maintaining files of clippings thematically is one method and files can be numbered and catalogued.
The other method is keying in the computer if you have one.
The information thus stored should be available for ready reference.
