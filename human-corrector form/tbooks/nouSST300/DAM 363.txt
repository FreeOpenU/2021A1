7 iv Introduction Economic Statistics is a two-credit first semester course.
It is a course available to students offering Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) degree in computer and information communication technology.
Economic Statistics is applying statistics to economic problems.
The scholar who specialises in the field of economic statistics is primarily an economic statistician and must be sound in the application of different statistical and economic tools to solve real life economic problems in the same way with his colleagues who specialise in other areas of economics and statistics.
Indeed, there is no way we will make mention of real life economic problems without considering economic statistics as the means to solving the problems.
The concept of applied statistics has various meanings to people in different fields.
The concern of economic statisticians is with statisticians, economists, business people (men and women) and researchers (in any area of specialisation).
Economic Statistics is a discipline which measures economic problems and provides solutions to them.
The purpose underlying the study of Economic Statistics is to apply economic and statistical tools to solve real life economic problems.
What you will learn in this course The course consists of units and a course guide.
The course guide tells you briefly what the course is about, what course materials you will be using and how you can work with these materials.
In addition, it advocates some general guidelines for the amount of time you are likely to spend on each unit of the course in order to complete it successfully.
It gives you guidance in respect of your Tutor-Marked Assignment which will be made available in the assignment file.
There will be regular tutorial classes that are related to the course.
It is advisable for you to attend these tutorial sessions.
The course will prepare you for the challenges you will meet in economic statistics.
Course Aims The aim of the course is to provide you with an understanding of economic statistics.
It also aims to provide you solutions to real life economic problems.
Course Objectives To achieve the aims set out, the course has a set of objectives.
Each unit has specific objectives which are included at the beginning of the v  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS unit.
You should read these objectives before you study the unit.
You may wish to refer to them during your study to check on your progress.
You should always look at the unit objectives after the completion of each unit.
By doing so, you would have followed the instructions in the unit.
Below are comprehensive objectives of the course as a whole.
By meeting these objectives, you should have achieved the aims of the course as a whole.
At the end of this course, you should be able to: • explain the concept of applied statistics • extrapolate the application of applied statistics on real life economic problems • describe measures of dispersion and probability theory • explain the concept of estimation and hypothesis testing in statistical inference • explain index numbers and its application to solve economic problems • explain the concept of purchasing power parity and its application to evaluate the economic health of nations • explain the concept of human development and its measurement • describe the basic concept of corruption indexes, effects, problems and the solutions to the problems of corruption on the economy • describe the concept of economic liberalisation and globalisation.
Working through this Course To complete this course, you are required to read each study unit, read the textbooks and read other materials which may be provided by the National Open University of Nigeria.
Each unit contains self assessment exercises and at certain points in the course, you would be required to submit assignments for assessment purposes.
At the end of the course, there is a final examination.
The course should take you about 17 weeks to complete.
Below, you will find listed, all the components of the course, what you have to do and how you should allocate your time to each unit in order to complete the course on time and successfully.
This course entails that you spend a lot of time to read.
I would advise that you avail yourself the opportunity of attending the tutorial sessions where you have the opportunity of comparing your knowledge with that of other people.

The 13th unit is concerned with the concept of human development and human development indices.
Unit 14 deals with the meaning of corruption, corruption indexes, effects of corruption on the economy and also, problems and solutions to corruption Unit 15 focuses on the concepts of liberalisation and globalisation and the effects of liberalisation and globalisation on developing countries.
Each unit consists of one or two weeks work and includes introductions, objectives, main content, self assessment exercises, conclusion, summary, tutor-marked assignments (TMAs),references/ further reading.
The unit directs you to work on exercises related to the required reading.
In general, these exercises test you on the materials you have just covered and thereby assist you to evaluate your progress and to reinforce your comprehension of the material.
Together with the TMAs, these exercises will help you in achieving the stated learning objectives of the individual units and of the course as a whole.
Presentation Schedule Your course materials have important dates for the early and timely completion and submission of your TMAs and attending tutorials.
You should remember that you are required to submit all your assignments by the stipulated time and date.
You should guard against falling behind in your work.
Assessment There are three aspects to the assessment of the course.
The first is made up of self assessment exercises, the second consists of the tutor-marked viii DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS assignments and the third is the written examination/end of course examination.
You are advised to do the exercises.
In tackling the assignments, you are expected to apply information, knowledge and technique you gathered during the course.
The assignments must be submitted to your facilitator for formal assessment in accordance with the deadlines stated in the presentation schedule and the assignment file.
The work you submit to your tutor for assessment will count for 30% of your total course work.
At the end of the course, you will need to sit for a final or end of course examination of about three hour duration.
This examination will count for 70% of your total course mark.
Tutor-Marked Assignments (TMA) The TMA is a continuous assessment component of your course.
It accounts for 30% of the total score.
You will be given four TMAs to answer.
Three of these must be answered before you are allowed to sit for the end of course examination.
The TMAs would be given to you by your facilitator and returned after you have done the assignment.
Assignment questions for the units in this course are contained in the assignment file.
You will be able to complete your assignment from the information and material contained in your reading, references and study units.
However, it is desirable in all degree level of education to demonstrate that you have read and researched more into your references, which will give you a wider view point and may provide you with a deeper understanding of the subject.
Make sure that each assignment reaches your facilitator on or before the deadline given in the presentation schedule and assignment file.
If for any reason you cannot complete your work on time, contact your facilitator before the assignment is due to discuss the possibility of an extension.
Extension will not be granted after the due date unless there are exceptional circumstances.
Final Examination and Grading The end of course examination for economic statistics will be for about three hours and it has a value of 70% of the total course work.
The examination will consist of questions, which will reflect the type of self-testing, practice exercise and tutor-marked assignment problems you have previously encountered.
All areas of the course will be assessed.
Revise the whole course after finishing the last unit and while waiting for the time to sit for the final examination.
You might ix  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS find it useful to review your self assessment exercises, TMAs and comments written on them by your facilitator before the final examination.
The final examination covers information from all parts of the course.
Course Marking Scheme Assignment Marks Assignments 1-4 Four assignments, best three marks of the four at 10% each -30% of course marks.
End of course examination 70% of overall course marks.
Total 100% .
Facilitators/Tutors and Tutorials There are 16 hours of tutorials provided in support of this course.
You will be notified of the dates, times and location of these tutorials as well as the name and phone numbers of your facilitator, as soon as you are allocated a tutorial group.
Your facilitator will mark and comment on your assignments.
Keep a close watch on your progress and other difficulties you might face and report these to your facilitator who will provide assistance to you during the course.
You are expected to mail your Tutor-Marked Assignments to your facilitator before the scheduled date (at least two working days are required).
The assignments will be marked by your tutor and returned to you as soon as possible.
Do not delay to contact your facilitator by telephone or e-mail if you need assistance.
The following might be circumstances in which you would find assistance necessary, hence you would have to contact your facilitator if: • you do not understand any part of the study or the assigned readings • you have difficulty with the self-tests • you have a question or problem with an assignment or with the grading of an assignment.
You should endeavour to attend the tutorials.
This is the only chance to have face to face contact with your course facilitator and to ask questions which are answered instantly.
You can raise any problem encountered in the course of your study.
x DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS To gain much benefit from course tutorials, prepare a question list before attending them.
You will learn a lot from participating actively in discussions.
Summary Economic Statistics is a course that intends to provide solutions to real life economic problems.
It also serves as a tool, which often enables the economists, to widen the frontiers of their analytical concerns to issues that have significant economic implications.
Nevertheless, do not forget to apply the principles you have learnt to your understanding of economics and statistics.
I wish you success in the course and I hope that you will find it comprehensive and interesting.

Economic statistics is also referred to as a subtopic of official statistics, since most of the economic statistics are produced by official organisations (e.g.
statistical institutes, intergovernmental organisations such as United Nations, European Union or OECD, central banks, ministries, etc.).
Economic Statistics provides the empirical data needed in economic research (econometrics) and it is the basis for decision and economic policy making.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define statistics • describe various sampling techniques • explain various types and methods of data collection • distinguish between the following: primary and secondary data, sample and population.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 What is Statistics?
Statistics is the body of theory, concepts, methods and methodologies of collection, analysis, interpretation and representation of numerical data relating to socio-economic and political activities.
The analysis of such data enables us to make valid conclusion and reasonable decisions about the present, near and distant future of any business activities Statistics also plays a dual role, firstly: It is studied to learn how to gather together and summarise data in such a way as to make them readily comprehensible; this is called descriptive statistics.
Secondly, it may be studied primarily with the aim of learning to draw conclusions from data; this is called inferential statistics.
The two must go hand in hand.
First, we must collect data in such a way that meaningful results may be anticipated; then we describe the data, and lastly draw inferences from it.
2 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS The field of Statistics can be divided into two main parts: 1.
Mathematical Statistics: This concerns the development of new methods of statistical inference and requires detailed knowledge of abstract mathematics for its implementation.
2.
Applied Statistics: This concerns the application of the methods of mathematical statistics to specific subject areas, such as economics, psychology, business, public health, demography, biostatistics etc.
3.2 Collecting and Analysing Statistical Data Statistical analysis begins with the collection of data.
The way this is done is probably the most important aspect of the investigation because, any interpretation of the figures will be faulty if the data on which it is based is unreliable; when this happens, bias does exist.
3.2.1 Sources of Bias in Statistical Data This exists when: i.. using the data from responses to questions e.g.
if information about the ages of a group of people is gathered by asking them to fill a questionnaire, over aged people may enter less than their true ages.
In fact, people do lie, for many different reasons, in response to questionnaires administered to them ii.
using data that does not properly apply to the problem being investigated e.g.
using published number of AIDS victims to investigate the number of people with AIDS.
The figures on AIDS victims are based on the number of people who registered as having the disease.
This does not include other categories of people who have the disease but are often guilty of declaring it.
3.2.2 Evaluation of Statistical Investigations Statistical investigation is only good if the quality of the data on which it is based is good.
If the data is faulty, any conclusion, however good the analysis is, will not be reliable.
Then, the following questions should be asked about the data used in any investigation.
• Where did the data come from?
• Who is supplying it and why?
• How was the data collected?
• Is it all the relevant data or a sample?
• If a sample is used, how was the sample chosen?
• Is the data relevant to the investigation?
• Does the conclusion follow from the information?
3  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.2.3 Why do we study Statistics?
Statistics is basically applied for the purpose of describing data and making inferences.
It shows the interrelationship between variables in a clearer form and provides good measure of comparison.
It is also used to understand properly the numerical information in a more readable form.
Suppose that, an education authority needs to decide whether or not to build a new primary school.
One factor in this decision must be the likely demand for schools in the future.
Then knowledge, about the birth-rate, migration, the age profile of the population etc.
can show a trend which can help in making judgments about future demands.
This is not the only consideration, but a decision made without the statistical information is less likely to be a good one.
The more you know about statistics, the better you are able to make reasonable decisions based on statistical evidence.
3.2.4 Data and Information In many situations where we require information, it is impossible to collect all the necessary facts.
We may wish to know, for instance, average annual salary for all females currently employed in Nigeria.
It would be totally impractical to try and find each appropriate individual annual salary and then average them.
Instead, we might select a suitable sample of females currently employed and average their annual salaries.
This average would be our estimate for the overall average annual salary of females currently employed in Nigeria.
Running any business organisation requires statistical information to be obtained e.g.
planning future sales targets requires past sales data to be obtained; making up employees wages requires data from clock cards to be obtained.
Once statistical information is available, it can be used by managers to obtain the best results consistent with the objectives of the organisation.
3.2.5 Data Data are raw facts, unassembled and frequently unrelated to one another.
It relates to facts, events, transactions etc.
4 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.2.6 Information If a data is processed in some ways, it becomes information.
Then, information can be defined as a collection of related places of data.
Ways of transforming data into Information (i) By bringing related pieces of data together (ii) By summarising data (iii) By tabulation and diagrammatic techniques (iv) By statistical analysis (v) Final report 3.2.7 Types of Data There are two types of data, namely: primary and secondary data.
3.2.8 Primary Data This data is especially collected for the purpose for which it is required.
This is the data that one collects by himself.
We may collect information from the whole population or use sampling by investigating only part of the population.
Primary data helps us to understand any curiosity that it contains.
Methods of Collecting Primary Data (i) Direct Measurement: Where the information we require can be measured or counted, we can arrange for ourselves or someone else to take the necessary measurements directly without recourse to a third party influence.
This method has the distinct advantage that accurate measurements can be obtained.
It can however, turn out to be very time-consuming and costly if misused.
Furthermore, there are only certain measurements which can be taken directly.
(ii) Experimentation: This is used more by the scientists than the businessmen and is linked closely to the method of direct observation.
It is a method where a particular treatment is given to the population or the people to determine the effect it has on the population e.g.
applying fertilizer on different crops to determine their yields, determine the consumers’ behaviour towards a new product due to advertisement etc.
(iii) By Observation: This involves watching or counting events as they happen and it is used primarily for traffic censuses and in work study.
Collections of physical, chemical, biological, traffic flow etc.
fall under this category.
But in most cases, it would he 5  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS uneconomical and in certain circumstances inapplicable.
For example, it would be ridiculous to follow people around every day to find out how often they clean their teeth.
(iv) Questionnaire: This method is mostly prominent in social sciences.
This is where an interviewer has a set of questions (the questionnaire) which he or she administers to the respondents (persons chosen to be in the sample).
This is a method often adopted in town centres or when interviewers visit the respondents’ homes or places of work.
It has the advantage that the results can be obtained quickly and reliably.
Due to the high response rate obtained when using this method, it is usually considered the most effective way of obtaining data.
This method is subdivided into three parts - by post, face-to-face interview and by phone.
3.2.9 Secondary Data This is the data which had already been collected by us or some other agencies for a different purpose but which is relevant to our present investigation.
It is the data taken from some other sources.
3.2.10 Sources of Secondary Data i.
Those produced by individual companies, local authorities, trade union, pressure groups, labour research, financial times etc.
ii.
Through government statistics such as Federal Bureau of Statistics (FOS), annual abstracts, national income and expenditure register, employment gazette, business monitors etc.
3.2.11 Problems Associated with Secondary Data i.
The major problem with secondary data is that it has not been collected specifically for the purpose required.
This means that if we are to use it, we must check to ensure we understand what the figures collected represent, that is, the population which we are investigating the figures of, to the accuracy we require and finally, the trustworthiness of the figures.
ii.
Is the information actual, seasonally adjusted, estimated or projected?
iii.
The reason for collecting the data may be unknown.
iv.
The data may be incomplete.
3.2.12 Population and Sample Non-statistician describes population as a group of people living in a delineated territory at a specified time.
However, a statistical 6 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS population covers a much wider field and does apply to people and objects.
3.2.13 Population This is the whole group of items or people we are concerned with.
Then, if one examines a small part of the group it is called a sample.
A population can be finite or infinite; a finite population is the one in which the number is countable otherwise, it is infinite e.g.
the population consisting the number of bournvita tins produced in a day by Cadbury Nig.
Plc is finite while the population consisting of all possible outcomes (heads or tails) in successive tosses of a coin is infinite.
3.2.14 Sample If deciding that collection of statistical data from a whole population is inappropriate, time consuming and capital intensive, then we need to choose a sample.
But the sample must be unbiased and chosen from the right population.
How do we select our sample?
Many techniques of sampling are in use.
Meanwhile, before any technique can be considered, the situation, including limitations of cost and time, must be considered.
3.3 Methods of Sampling There are four different methods of taking samples from population.
(i) Simple Random Sampling A random sample is a sample selected in such a way that every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
It is a definite method of selection aimed at eliminating bias as far as possible.
This can be achieved by numbering every member of a population, putting their numbers in a bag, mixing the numbers together and drawing out numbers of those to be in the sample e.g.
raffle or lottery.
Also, a computer can be programmed to turn out a series of random numbers which will identify the items to be used in the sample.
If a computer cannot be afforded then, a table of random numbers can be used.
(ii) Systematic Sampling This is a method used where we sample each item at kth interval.
It is the sampling at regular intervals from an ordered sampling frame.
Consider a sample of individuals drawn from a population of N individuals by: (a) choosing one individual at random (b) choosing every kth individual thereafter, returning to the beginning of the list.
7  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS When you have reached the end, k could be chosen as N/n.
If a list of all items in a population exists (e.g.
electoral register) or if the population items are filed in order e.g.
(invoices/credit notes) then systematic sampling may be used.
(iii) Multi-stage Sampling If the simple or stratified random sampling is considered to be time consuming and capital intensive then, multistage sampling may be used.
In multi-stage sampling, we select a few areas which we believe are representative of the population as a whole.
We then take a random sample within each of these areas, when the population is well spread out, particularly geographically.
Simple random sampling will result in a dispersed sample.
As an enumerator, you would probably object to doing a grand tour of the area, asking questions of only one particular person in each place you visited.
Some methods are needed to ‘narrow the field down’ to a smaller area.
Multi-stage attempts to do this without adversely affecting the randomness of the result.
The first step is to divide the population into manageable, convenient groups or areas.
The process may be taken one (or several) stages further to reduce the sample area to more manageable proportions.
Finally, a simple random or systematic sample will be used to select the eligible respondents.
(iv) Cluster Sampling This is a selection from randomly chosen groups of neighbouring individuals.
It is easy to confuse this with multi-stage sampling as the first-stage appears to be identical.
The major difference is that cluster sampling is used when the population has not been listed and it is the only way to obtain a sample.
It is not used primarily as means of reducing costs.
(v) Stratified Sampling This is the act of dividing the sample frame into non-overlapping subsets, with proportionate simple random sampling from each subset.
In some situations, it is possible to improve on simple random sampling by stratification of the population.
This is particularly true where the population is heterogeneous (i.e., made up of dissimilar groups) and the population can be stratified into homogeneous (i.e.
similar) classes.
8 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS (vi) Quota Sampling This is non-random sampling of targeted sets of individuals.
This is done by specifying how many people or items within a certain group you want to be sampled (set a quota) and then collect data from anyone or anything fitting into the required category until the quota is filled.
This method is widely used by interviewers encountered in town centres, streets and market research.
The main advantage of this method is that, if a respondent refuses to answer the questions for any reason, the interviewer will just look for another person in the same category.
(vii) Judgment Sampling Here, an expert, or a team of experts, uses personal judgement to select what a truly representative sample would be.
It certainly cannot be called a random sample as it involves human judgement which could involve bias.
(viii) Convenience Sampling The most important factor here is the ease of selecting the sample.
No effort is made to introduce any element of randomness.
An example of this is a quality controller who takes the first 50 items of the production line as his sample.
This is a dangerous procedure as any fault in the process occurring after or before this could remain unnoticed until the next sample is taken.
(ix) Sampling with Probability Proportional to Size This is a method of sampling in the first or second stage of a multi-stage sample.
It is designed to ensure that the probability of selection of a sub-unit is proportional to the number of elements of the population in the sub-unit.
3.4 Variables A variable is a measurement which varies from one individual to another or from one item to another e.g.
the number of mistakes in a set of accounts, the weight of a steel bar, age, time etc.
3.4.1 Types of Variables i. Discrete Variables These are variables which can only take whole numbers or integer values e.g.
the number of people who watch a particular programme on 9  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS the television, the number of people sitting for an examination etc.
Generally, when we count things, the answers we get are whole numbers, these are discrete variables.
ii.
Continuous Variables These are variables, which can take any value within a certain range, so a decimal or fractional value can be obtained for continuous variables e.g.
the length of a bar, the time to produce a particular item, the temperature of a place at a particular time, volume, average etc.
3.4.2 Types of Data Discrete Data It consists of numerical values in situations where one can make a list of the possible values e.g.
1, 2, 3, 4.
Continuous Data It consists of numerical values in cases where it is not possible to make a list of outcomes e.g.
height, mass, time, weight etc.
Data can also be classified as either Qualitative or Quantitative.
(a) Qualitative Data i. Nominal This consists of unordered 'either' or observations e.g.
Dead or Alive, Male or Female, Cured or Not Cured, Blood group A, O, B or AB, Pregnant or Not Pregnant; Infected or Not Infected etc.
ii.
Ordered Classifications If there are more than two categories of classifications, it may be possible to order them in some ways: e.g.
after treatment, a patient can be improved; the same or worse.
iii.
Ranked Data In some studies, it may be appropriate to use classifications that can be ranked e.g.
patients with rheumatoid arthritis may be asked to order their preference for four dressing aids.
Here, although numerical values are assigned to each aid, one cannot assume they behave as numbers.
They are in fact only codes for best, second best, 10 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS third best and worst.
Another example is that a feature of the patient may be classified as being either ‘nil’, ‘mild’, ‘moderate’, ‘severe’, ‘very severe’ on a rating scale may classify the patient as being in one of the grades I, II, III, IV or V. It is however, important that the use of numbers to label categories or grades is not taken to imply that a truly quantitative measurement has been obtained; the numbers are being used purely for their ordinal relationship to each other.
(b) Numerical or Quantitative Data i.
Numerical Discrete This consists of counts e.g.
numbers of babies born to 1000 women in 3 years, number of customers who patronise ‘Mr.
Bigg’s’ daily, etc.
ii.
Numerical Continuous Such data are measurements that can in theory at least, take any value within a given range e.g.
gestation period, ovulation period, birth weight of baby etc.
3.5 Errors Statistical errors are majorly concerned with estimating an uncertainty.
It is also concerned about the size, relative size and nature of errors.
Two questions are normally asked concerning statistical errors.
(i) Are the errors always positive?
(ii) Do these errors cancel out?
3.5.1 Statistical Errors In statistical investigation, attempt is always made to estimate values or quantities.
Estimations such as the followings may occur.
(i) What is the average stock we are expecting this week from a particular company?
(ii) What is the profit that will be made in two years?
(iii) How many people will become Chartered Accountants in five years?
These are always made before the actual occurrence of any event.
But, whatever it is to be estimated, one is subject to getting the wrong answer or prediction.
11  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.5.2 Nature of Statistical Errors (a) Bias If the estimates of values are either consistently above or below the correct or target value, then the tendency to overestimate or underestimate is called bias.
(b) Precision Many results are usually collected or obtained in most statistical investigations.
Consistency of these results with one another would be an indication of how good the estimates are.
The closer the results, the more precision they are said to have.
Precision is the term used to describe how consistent the results are to one another.
(c) Accuracy Accuracy is used to describe how close a result is to the true target value.
It is however, important to note that precision and accuracy are not the same.
A set of results could be very similar to one another, but despite that, it could be above or below the true value and hence may not be accurate.
3.6 History of Statistics Some scholars pinpoint the origin of statistics to 1662, with the publication of Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality by John Graunt.
Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its stat- etymology.
The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general.
Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and the natural and social sciences.
Because of its empirical roots and its focus on applications, statistics is usually considered to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of Mathematics.
Its mathematical foundations were laid in the 17th century with the development of probability theory by Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat.
Probability theory arose from the study of games of chance.
The method of least squares was first described by Carl Friedrich Gauss around 1794.
The use of modern computers has expedited large-scale statistical computation, and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually.

data basically concerned with a single quantity).
These measures assume that the variables or the data provided concentrate at a point.
They answer the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean, median and mode of the distribution.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain measure of location • calculate the mean, median and mode for grouped and ungrouped data • enumerate the advantages and disadvantages of measure of location.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Arithmetic Mean If we have a list of items or values for a discrete variable for ungrouped data, then the arithmetical mean is the simple average of the values.
It is calculated by adding all the values together and dividing by the total number of values in our list.
15  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS This is represented as Where n is the number of observations If the observation occurs frequently then, it changes to Where f is the frequency Example 1 The heights in meters of 12 walnut plants, after twenty years growth are 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4.8, 4.5, 7.2.
5.2 The mean is 4+5+6+3+7+2+5.5+4.8+4.5+7.2+5.1 = 12 62 = = 5.17 12 Example 2 The number of employees in 7 commercial banks in Lagos is given as 4368, 4387, 4334, 4383, 4356, and 4369.
Find the mean Solution ∑ n x = n 4368+4387+4697+4331+4383+4356+4369 = 7 30591 = = 4370.14 7 Assumed Mean method For an ungrouped data: ∑ d Mean = A + i n Where A is the assumed mean 16 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS d is the deviation from assumed mean i n is the number of observations Example 3 Using Example 2 above, compute the mean, using assumed mean method.
Solution The value A must be chosen within the range of the given values for easy calculation.
Here, let A = 4369 d = xi –A X 4368 4387 4397 4331 4383 4356 4369 ∑d i D -1 18 28 -38 14 -13 0 8 ∑ d \ Mean = A + i n 8 = 4369 + 7 = 4370.14 Mean for Grouped: Discrete Data If the data is given as a frequency table with frequencies for individual values or if the observations occur frequently then; ∑ fx Mean = ∑ f Where f is the frequency or number of observations Example 4 The table below shows the number of chocolates bought in a super market per day X 0 1 2 3 4 6 F 3 9 15 23 11 2 17  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Find the mean?
Solution Mean = x 0· 3+1· 9+2· 15+3· 23+4· 11+6· 2 = 3+9+15+23+11+12 164 = = 2.603 63 Mean for Grouped Data with Class Intervals Here, to calculate the mean we start by adjusting the interval so that they are the equivalent of continuous intervals.
Having done this, we encounter the problem which always arises with grouped data, because we do not know the exact value for each result in an interval.
This makes it necessary to approximate and this is done by assuming that all values in an interval are at the mid-point of the interval.
Example 5 The data below shows the weight (kg) of 20 students in a class.
Find the mean weight.
Weight (kg) 46-50 51-55 56-60 61-65 Number of students 7 5 6 2 Solution ∑ fx Mean = ∑ f Weight f x fx 46-50 7 48 336 51-55 5 53 265 56-60 6 58 348 61-65 2 63 126 20 1075 1075 = 20 = 53.75kg 18 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Assumed Mean Method of Estimating Arithmetic Mean The technique involves the use of the formula ∑ fd Mean (x) = A+ ∑ f Where‘d’ is the deviation from the assumed mean ‘A’ is the assumed mean, which may be taken within or outside the distribution.
However, it is better to choose the value of A within the distribution.
Example 6 Use the data in example 6 above to compute the mean using assumed mean method.
Solution Choose the assumed man to be 35.

21  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Advantages of Arithmetic Mean i.
It is easy to compute ii.
It has determinate exact value iii.
The calculation is clear and precise iv.
It uses all the items in the data in its calculation v. It provides a good measure of comparison.
vi.
It can be used for further statistical calculations or processing.
Disadvantages of Arithmetic Mean i.
It cannot be obtained graphically except if the graph is symmetric.
ii.
If some values are missing it cannot be calculated.
iii.
It can be distorted by extreme values in the distribution.
iv.
The mean may be significantly affected by the inclusion of mistake in the observation.
Geometric Mean This can be calculated using the formula below: G.M = n x f1x f2....x fm 1 2 m ∑ When n f Example 9 Find the geometric mean of the following data 3, 2, 6, 4 Solution G.M.

This inequality could be verified using a set of data.
Example 11 The number of times a patient takes a prescribed drug over a period of days is given in the data below; 3,5,2, 6.
Compute the arithmetic mean, harmonic mean and geometric mean.
Hence, compare your results.
Solution ∑ x Arithmetic Mean (A.M.) = n = 3+5+2+6 4 = 16 = 4 4 Geometric Mean (G.M.)

The equality holds i.e.
H.M. = G.M.
= A.M., only if all the items in the data are equal or the same.
Root Mean Square (R.M.S) If n is the number of occurrence of a particular variable x i.e.
x , x …x .
1 2 n Then the root mean square n 2 ∑ x R.M.S.
= i=1 i n Example 12 Find the root mean square of the heights in ft. of 5 students in a class-3 2, 4, 6, 7 Solution 32 +22 +42 +62 +32 R.M.S = 5 = 22.8 = 4.775 3.2 Median This is the item that divides the set of data into two equal halves.
It is the middle item.
However, the data must be arranged in either ascending or descending order of magnitude.
If a set of data has odd number of ( ) N +1th observation then, the median item is item where n is the 2 number of observation.
But for even number of items, the median is the average of the two middle numbers after ordering.
24 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Example 13 The heights of girls in a class are 3, 2, 4, 1, 5, 3, and 6 Since this is an odd number of items i.e.
7 ( ) N +1th \ The medianth item = item 2 7+1 = = 4 2 \ 1, 2, 3, 3, , 5, 6 Then, the median = 3 Example 14 Find the median of the following data i.e.
8, 3, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 9 Solution Ordering the data gives: 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 This is an even number of items Note: N = 8 N 8 \ = = 4 2 2 Then, count 4 from the first and from the last items 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 5+6 \ Median = 2 11 = = 5.5 2 Median for Grouped Discrete Data If frequency table is provided for a discrete variable where the table has frequencies for individual values, then compute the cumulative frequency.
If the total number of values, n is odd, the median value is the value for which the cumulative frequency first exceeds or equals: N +1 2 25  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS But if n is even, the median is the value for which cumulative frequency first exceed N/2.
If the cumulative frequency equal N/2 for a value, this means that the median is half-way between this value and the next value.
Example 15 The scores in a test by 55 students are given in the table below: No of students 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Score 3 8 20 14 6 3 1 Find the median.
Solution X Frequency Cumulative frequency 0 3 3 1 8 11 2 20 31 3 14 45 4 6 51 5 3 54 6 1 55 Since N is odd i.e.
N = 55 N +1 55+1 \ = = 28 2 2 N +1 Then, the value of is first exceeded by the figure for 2 marks 2 Then, the median is 2 marks Example 16 The numbers of items sold in a supermarket over a period of 40 days are shown in the table below: Items Sold 0 1 2 3 4 5 No of Days 1 3 16 11 5 4 Find the median of number of items sold.

interpolation and also by graphical method.
But these methods may waste your precious time.
The formula below is applied after identifying the median class that contains the middle observation.
(N - (∑ f) Median = L +  2 xc 1  f  median Where, L = lower class boundary of the median class 1 N = number of items.
∑ ( f) = sum of all frequencies of the class/classes lower 1 than the median class.
f = frequency of the median class median c = size of the median class.

(vi) It is unaffected by the presence of extreme values in the distribution Disadvantages of Median (i) The statistical properties are difficult to determine (ii) It is not useful for further statistical calculations (iii) It may require rearrangement of the data involved.
This may be difficult if large population is required.
(iv) It may not be representative if there are few data.
3.3 Mode 29  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS This is the item that occurs most in a set of data or list of items.
It is the item or value that has the highest frequency.
Example 19 Find the modal item in 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, and 2 Solution The item that occurs most is 2 and hence the mode = 2, bimodal values occur when two or more figures have the highest frequency.
Then, the mode is obtained by taking the arithmetical mean of the two values.
Example 20 Find the mode of the data below 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 6, 3, 3, 4, 4, and 4 Solution The numbers 3 and 4 have the same frequency and this frequency is the highest N 3+4 Then, Mode = = = 3.5 2 2 If a frequency table for a discrete variable is provided and that the table has frequencies for individual values, then the mode is the number that has the highest frequency on the table.
But if two or more numbers have this highest frequency, the mode is obtained by taking the arithmetic mean of the values.
Example 21 The table below shows the number of accident on a road per day and this is observed for five consecutive days.
Find the mode.
Days 1 2 3 4 5 Freq 10 11 18 3 2 Solution 30 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS The mode is simply 3 because it has highest frequency.
Mode for Grouped, Discrete Data with Equal Class Intervals To determine a value for the mode here, we must at first determine which interval has the highest frequency.
This is called the modal interval or modal class.
Then the formula below is used.
 D  Mode = L1+  1 xc D +D   1 2 Where, L is the lower class boundary of the modal class 1 D is the excess of modal frequency over the frequency of immediate 1 lower class i.e.
D = f -f 1 m m-1 D is the excess of modal frequency over the frequency of immediate 1 Upper class i.e.
D = f -f c is the class width or size.
2 m m+1 Example 22 The frequency distributions of storm duration (in minutes) are based on data appearing in the article “Lighting phenomenology in the Tampa Bay Area”.
Use the data to estimate the mode.
Storm duration 0-25 25-50 50-75 75-100 100-125 Single Peak(f) 3 6 17 15 9 Solution Here, the class boundaries have been set.
There is no need of constructing the class boundaries The highest occurrence of storm duration is 17 Then, the modal class = 50-75 L =50, D = 17 -6= 11, D = 17 -5 = 12, c = 25 1 1 2  D  \ mode = L + 1 xc 1 D +D   1 2  11  = 50+ x25   11+12 = 61.96 Example 23 31  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS The table shows the wage of the 50 employees in Adebowale Nig.

It can be obtained graphically ii.
It is not affected by extreme values iii It is easy to understand and compute iv.
If a mode exists, it is certain to have a value that was actually observed v. The data does not need any ordering before mode can be obtained.
Disadvantages of Mode 32 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS i.
It can be a very poor average if the data is not symmetrical ii.
It is not an ideal measure of central tendencies iii.
It is not useful in further statistical processing iv.
It does not make use of all the values in the distribution v. Its statistical properties are difficult to determine vi.
It may not be unique because two or more values may be equally frequent.

In many instances, the dispersion of the data is of at least as much interest as is the mean.
If measures of location are used to compare two sets of each data, there may be difference in the extent to which their values spread around the central or mean value.
Measures of location cannot distinguish between the sets in such cases.
Hence, measures of dispersion are applied.
37  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain what measures of dispersion are • calculate, based on measures of dispersion and using various methods on both grouped and ungrouped data • list the advantages and disadvantages of the measure of dispersion.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Definition of Dispersion Dispersion is the degree to which a numerical data tend to spread about an average value.
Measures of dispersion are referred to as the spread of a set of data.
When mean or average is in focus from other variables, it is called measures of dispersion.
3.2 Range The range of a set of numerical data is the difference between the highest and the lowest values.
It is the ‘spread’ or ‘width of the data.
Advantages of Range a.
It is easy to calculate b.
It is the simplest possible measure of spread c. It may be useful for further statistical calculations.
Disadvantages of Range a.
It depends on extreme values.
So it is susceptible to odd results b.
It only uses two values-the remaining data is ignored c. It cannot be used to calculate open-ended distribution d. It cannot be used with grouped data, since it ignores the intermediate values.
3.3 Interquartile Range This is the difference between the upper quartile and lower quartile i.e.
Q =Q -Q 1 3 1 38 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.3.1 Semi-Interquartile Range or Quartile Deviation This is the half of the interquartile range.
This is otherwise known as quartile deviation.
Qs = ½ [Q -Q ] 3 1 Example 1 The marks scored by 7 students in a test are: 3, 7, 2, 10, 2 and 6.
Find the range?
Solution Range = 10-2=8 Computing Quartile for Grouped Data N  i- ∑ f c    4 i Qi = Li_ where I = 1, 2,3,4. f q L = Lower class boundary of the quartile class i N = Number of observations ∑ f = Cumulative frequency just before the quartile class.
i c = Size of the quartile class f = Frequency of the quartile class q Advantages of Quartile Deviation a.
It is easy to understand b.
It is unaffected by the presence of extreme values in the distribution c. It is half the range of the middle 50% of values, so it tells us about the spread of the middle values.
Disadvantages of Quartile Deviation a.
It does not make use of all the items in the data for its computations b.
It is not suitable for further statistical analysis c. It is rather awkward to calculate d. It may not be representative if there are few data.

Mean deviation is referred to as the average amount by which a value in a distribution differs from the arithmetic mean.
It is otherwise known as mean absolute deviation.

The more variation there is in the x-values, the larger will be the ( ) ∑ x- x 2 value of n ( ) ∑ x- x 2 Or Variance = n- 1 Note i.
Using the divisor n It is appropriate in two cases: a.
When the values x , x … x represent the whole population 1 2 n b.
When the values x , x … x represent a sample from a population 1 2 n and we are concerned about the variation within the sample itself.
Then, the variance is denoted by: ( ) s 2 = 1∑n x- x 2 n n  i=1 If x , x , …, x represent a sample of data then,s 2 is called the sample 1 2 n n variance.
44 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS If x , x ,…, x represent the entire population then, s 2 is called the 1 2 n n population variance.
ii.
Using the division n-1 This is used when x , x … x represent a sample from a given 1 2 n population and we are concerned about the variation in the population.
The sample variance is denoted byS2ors 2 n- 1 N N S2 = 1S21+ 2SN22 N + N 1 3.6 Standard Deviation (SD) This is the positive square root of the mean of the squared deviations from the arithmetic mean of the distribution.
It is also the square root of the variance.
Standard deviation is used widely in statistics as a measure of spread.
3.6.1 Features of Standard Deviation i.
It makes use of all the values in the distribution ii.
It is the best measure of dispersion iii.
It corrects the mathematical inaccuracy of the mean deviation iv.
It is the most prominent measure of dispersion v. It can be used to determine the sample size to estimate the standard error of the sample mean in significance test.
vi.
It is difficult to compute when a grouped distribution has unequal interval or open ended class.
vii.
It is the basis for further statistical development viii.
It can be distorted by extreme values ix.
It is almost impossible to visualise what the standard deviation figure represents.

However, all the measures increase in size as the data values become more spread.
The range is sometimes used as a ‘quick’ method for finding spread but it is only applicable to a few data values.
The least used is the mean deviation.
Finally, whenever mean is used as a measure of location, standard deviation is usually quoted.
3.8 Decile and Percentile 3.8.1 Decile This is where the number of observations is divided into ten parts after ordering i.e.
arrangement in ascending or descending order of magnitude.
It is denoted by D , D , D ,…, D .
1 2 3 9 3.8.2 Percentile These are the numbers dividing the data into 100 parts after ordering.
They are represented by P , P , P , … P .
The values of 50th percentile, 1 2 3 99 49  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 25th percentile and 75th percentile represent the median, lower and upper percentile or quartiles respectively.
The two can be represented mathematically as: [ ] iN - ∑ f 10 1 Decile = L + xc 1 f d [ ] iN - ∑ f Percentile =L + 100 1 xc 1 f p Where; L = the lower class boundary of either the decile or percentile 1 class as the case may be N = Number of items in the data ∑ f = Cumulative frequency just before the decile or percentile 1 class f = Frequency of the decile class d f =Frequency of the percentile class p Example 11 The data below shows the heights of maize in (m) planted over a given period of time: 2,11,19,27,6,9,15,13.

It is basically used for comparison i.e.
enables us to compare the dispersion of two distributions in widely different units e.g.
yearly output of two factories producing different commodities; change in temperature over a period of time in two countries; imported goods into two different countries etc.
The standard deviation alone does not measure relative variation.
For example, a standard deviation of $ 1 would be considered large if it is describing the variability from store to store in the price of an ice cube tray.
On the other hand, a standard deviation of $1 would be considered small if it is describing store-to-store variability in the price of a particular brand of freezer.
COV can be expressed mathematically as: Standard Deviation 100 COV = · Mean 1 s 100 = · x 1 Example 13 A standard deviation of N10 per day on a mean daily wage of N300 will be insignificant.
However, a standard deviation of N10 on a mean of N 40 daily wage is a very serious variation.
Solution For the two situations: A: x = 300 s = N10 s 100 10 100 COV = · = · x 1 300 1 = 3.33% B: x = 40 s = N10 s 100 10 100 \ COV = · = · x 1 40 1 = 25% 53  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS This shows that the variability of data B is higher than that of A.
This implies that the wage differences in data B are wider than that of A.

Under uncertainty, one does not know which of several events or outcomes will occur in the future.
Because of the importance of uncertainty, a precise terminology for dealing with uncertainty is needed.
Probability theory is such a precise terminology: it is the language of uncertainty.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain probability theory and probability distributions • describe the approaches in assigning probabilities • define the rules of probability • itemise random variables • explain conditional probability together with some other standard probability distributions such as Bernoulli, binomial etc.
56 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Some Basic Definitions • A trial: this is any process or attempt which generates an outcome which cannot be predetermined.
A trial usually results into only one of the possible outcomes for example (I) a toss of a coin once, will lead to either a head (H) or a tail (I).
• A random experiment: this is an operation which when repeated, generates a number of outcomes which cannot be predetermined, for example, the toss of two coins at a time.
• An outcome: this is a possible result of a trial or experiment in a toss of two coins, an outcome could be any one of HH, HT, TH, and TT.
• Sample space: this is the collection of all possible outcomes.
It is a set of all finite or countable infinite number of elementary outcomes.
e.g.
the sample space in a toss of two coins is given as S= (HH, HT, TH, TT).
• An event: this is a subset of a sample space, it consists of one or more possible outcomes e.g.
when a die is tossed once.
A= (set of even number) = (2, 4, 6).
• Mutually exclusive events: two events, A & B are said to be mutually exclusive, if the occurrence of A prevents the occurrence of B.
This implies that the two units cannot occur together i.e.
answer = O.
• Mutually exhaustive events: events A and B are said to be mutually exhaustive if they constitute the sample space i.e.
- ∑ a = S i • Independent events: two events A & B are said to be helped if the occurrence of A does not affect B.
This implies that the two events can occur together.
3.2 Three Approaches to Defining Probability Depending upon the type of event to be performed, there are various ways of assigning probabilities to the sample events in a sample space.
i. Probabilities based on equally likely sample events (A prior probability): This method assumes that the elementary outcomes of an expected event are equally likely.
N(A) i.e.
P (A) = N(S) Where P(A) is the probability that event A will occur, N (A) is the event space and N(S) is the sample space.
57  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS ii.
Probabilities as relative frequency: This approach defines probabilities as an idealisation of the proportion of time that a certain event will occur in respected trial of an event under the same condition.
If what we expect is N and n(A) is the number of times that A occurs, n(A) then the relative frequency is R.F.
= N iii.
Subjective or personal probabilities: These are the probabilities assigned to an event based on subjective judgment from experience, information and behaviour.
Such probabilities assigned arbitrarily are usually influenced by the bias and experience of the person assigning it.
In general, probability can be defined as the likelihood or chance that an event will occur.
In other words, the probability of an event is the number of times the event occurs compared to the total possible equally likely time that the event can occur.
It is also defined as the limiting value of a relative frequency of an event.
3.3 Probability of Event The probabilities of an event are the sum of the probabilities of the simple events that make up the event.
Example A coin is rolled 3 times, what are the probabilities of getting: (i) 1 head (ii) 2 heads (iii) at least 2 heads Solution Let H & T represent H & T respectively, let the simple space be defined as S = (HHH, HTH, HHT, THH, TTH, HTT, THT, TTT).
(1) P (1head) = HTT, THT, TTH) = 3/8 (2) P (2heads) = (HHT, THH, HTT) = 3/8 (3) P (at least 2 heads)= P (2heads) + P (2heads) = 3/8 + 1/8 = 0.5 3.3.1 Rules of Probabilities i. P (AUB) = P(A) +P(B) – P(UB) ii.
P(A)= 1-P(A) iii.
P(A) = 1 for certainly then o< P(A) £ 1 58 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.4 Conditional Probability If E & E are 2 events, the probability that E occurs given that E has 1 2 2 1 occurred is denoted by P (E /E ) and it is called the conditional 2 1 probability of E given that E has occurred.
If the occurrence or non 2 1 occurrence of E does not affect the probability of occurrence of E then 1 2 Pr (E /E ) = P (E ) and we say that E and E are independent events 2 1 2 1 2 otherwise they are dependent events.

a fair coin is tossed 3 times.
The sample space S = {TTT,HTT,TTH,THT......HHH } Let x denote the number of heads which appears Then X = {0,1,2,3}.
(s) 3.5.1 Types of Random Variable There are 2 types of random variable namely: discrete and continuous random variable.
(i) Discrete random variable: A discrete random variable is a rule or function that assigns only specified numerical value often integer to the simple event of a sample space.
(ii) Continuous random variable: A continuous random variable is a rule or function that may assign any numerical value (within some limits) to simple events.
3.6 Probability Distribution for R.V.
Probability can be defined as the arrangement of the events and their corresponding probabilities in a tabular form.
However, the probability of any event depends on the type of variable involved.
60 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.6.1 Standard Probability Distribution i. Bernoulli distribution A random variable X that assigns only the value 0 or 1 is known as Bernoulli variable and a performance of an experiment with only 2 types of outcome is called Bernoulli trial.
The pdf can be experienced as f(x) = Pxq1-x, x= 0,1. ii.
Binomial distribution In a sequence of n independent, Bernoulli trial with probability of success P on each trial, let X represent the no of successes.
The discrete pdf of X is given by n f(x) =  pxqn- x x = 0,1,2,3....n x Example A fair coin is tossed 5 times, what are the probabilities of obtaining: (i) 3 heads (ii) less than 2 heads (iii) 2 or more heads Solution L = 5, p = 1/2, q = ½ n f(x)= pxqn- x x 51315- 3 i.

Poisson distribution A discrete random variable X with probability function ( ) lxe- l f x,l = X = 0,1,2,3.... X Where l > 0, is said to have a Poisson distribution with parameter l .

Formal statistical inference involves using the tool of probability theory to quantify the reliability of some kinds of data based on conclusions.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain estimation • identify point and interval estimation • explain confidence interval and its interpretation • calculate Confidence Interval [C.I] for a population mean and the difference between two means.
65  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Uses of Sampling for Making Inferences (i) A manager is interested in knowing the average age of the employees.
(ii) An advertising executive wants to know the proportion of subscribers to a certain magazine that remembers a particular advertisement.
(iii) A sales manager wants to know the proportion of the population of subscribers to a certain magazine that remembers a particular advertisement.
.
(iv) An educationist wants to know whether one educational procedure is better than another.
3.2 Sampling Theory This is the study of relationship that exists between a population and samples drawn from the population.
It is used in estimating unknown population parameters i.e.
the mean m and variances 2.
It is also useful in determining whether the observed differences between two samples are due to chance variation or significant.
3.3 Estimation Theory Estimation is basically concerned with estimated parameter from the sample statistics.
An estimator is the procedure or rule usually expressed as a mathematical formula that tests how an estimate is determined.
3.3.1 Types of Estimator An estimator is a formula or rule that we use to estimate the value of population parameters.
There are two types namely: point estimate and interval estimate.
(i) Point Estimate This is a numerical value obtained from a set of data, which is used as an estimate of an unknown parameter in a population e.g.
∑ x x = = is used as an estimate of sample mean n ∑(x - x)2 S2 = i is used as an estimate of the population variance.
n- 1 66 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS (ii) Interval Estimate This consists of an interval that contains the parameter to be estimated within varying degree of conditions.
Estimators are usually judged using the criteria below.
(i) Unbiasedness An estimator U is an unbiased estimator of population parameter θ if E (U) = θ (ii) Consistency If U is an unbiased estimator of θ and if Var (U) ⇒ θ as the sample size increases, then U is a consistent estimator of θ.
(iii) Efficiency If U and V are two unbiased estimators of θ with Var (U) < Var(V), then U is more efficient than V. (iv) Sufficiency Suppose x ,x ,…x is a random sample of size n and let T be an 1 2 n estimator of θ, if the conditional distribution of x , x , … x is 1 2 n given by T = t (for some given t) is independent of θ, the T is said to be sufficient for θ, if it contains all the relevant information available about θ from the given sample.
(v) Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator Let x ,x , … x be a random sample of size n from f(x, θ).
Let T 1 2 n = t (x ,x ,…x ) be an unbiased estimator of θ such that: 1 2 n E(T) = θ Var(T) <Var(T’) Where T is any other unbiased estimator of θ then T is said to be minimum variance unbiased estimator of θ.
3.4 Confidence Intervals Confidence Interval for a parameter (or function of one or more parameters) is a data-based interval of numbers thought likely to contain the parameter (or function of one or more parameters) possessing a stated probability-based confidence or reliability.
Based on a set of data, one might want to identify an interval of values that is likely to contain an unknown parameter and quantify in some sense “how likely” the interval is to cover the correct value.
A b % confidence interval for a population parameter is an interval obtained from a sample by some specified methods in such a way that, in repeated sampling, in the long run b % of the intervals thus obtained include the value of the parameter.]
67  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Illustration Consider a very simple research situation, in which a research worker wishes to estimate populations meanm .
A doctor wishes to study the effect of a new substance added to the diet of infants.
He gives the diet to a group of 16 infants and measures the gains in weight over a one month period.
He then, takes the arithmetic mean of the 16 gains in weight and finds, say x = 421.8g.
Normally, the specific sixteen infant gains are not the population which, as a research worker, the doctor wishes to study.
He really wishes to know the mean gain in weight for infants in general.
The population, then, consists of infants of the type whose diet comes under this doctor’s supervision, and he wishes to estimatem , the population mean.
The doctor’s best point estimate for m is his sample mean, or 421.
8g.
But it is practically certain them is not exactly 421.8g, and the doctor wishes to get some ideas of wherem may reasonably be expected to be.
Then, a confidence interval will be formed form .
If a higher confidence level is chosen, then, there is a greater confidence that the interval containm ; but on the other hand, we pay for this higher level of confidence by having a longer interval.
To obtain a shorter interval and at the same time having one in which we have a high level of confidence; the sample size must be increased.
Interpretation of a Confidence Interval To say that a numerical interval (a,b) is a 90% confidence interval for a parameter is to say that in obtaining it, one has applied methods of data collection and calculation that would produce intervals bracketing the parameter in about 90% of repeated applications.
3.5 Confidence Interval for a Population Mean The following cases should be considered.
A sample (large or small) is taken from a normally distributed population, with known variance.
s C.I.

= x– z a n A large sample is taken from an unknown population distribution with unknown variance: s C.I.
= x– z a n A sample (large or small) is taken from a normally distributed population with unknown variance.
s C.I.
= x– t n- 1 n Where xis the sample mean z is the confidence level a s is the standard deviation S is the sample standard deviation n is the sample size t is the confidence level with n-1 degree of freedom n- 1 Example 1 The standard deviation of bulbs manufactured by Solar Engineering Company is 5.6 if the mean life span of 64 bulbs were randomly selected from the lot as 60 days.

(i) Point estimate (ii) Interval estimate 4.0 CONCLUSION Estimation is a very useful tool for conveying from one person (statistician) to another person (the user) the information contained in a sample.
If a single number estimate is required, a point estimate is used.
If a measure of the precision of the estimate is required, the point estimate is converted into a confidence interval.
This unit has dealt with the two types of estimation: point estimate and confidence interval.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have learnt that: • point estimate is the single value computed using an estimator • a good estimator must be unbiased, consistent, efficient and sufficient • estimated parameter is obtained from sample statistics.

As a statement, it may or may not be true.
Perhaps supposition is a better word than hypothesis or statement.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain basic concept of hypothesis testing • identify the essence of test statistics in hypothesis testing • explain critical and acceptance regions • identify steps involved in hypothesis testing • explain how to solve problems that are concerned with hypothesis testing.
81  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 What is Hypothesis?
A hypothesis is an idea or suggestion that is based on known facts and is used as a basis for reasoning or further investigation.
Actually, a hypothesis is formulated with the hope of either accepting or rejecting it.
3.1.1 Types of Hypothesis (i) Null Hypothesis This is a statement that forms the basis of investigation in a significant test.
A null hypothesis is usually formed to embody a status quo ‘‘pre- data” view of the parameter (s).
It is typically symbolised as H .
The 0 null part of the phrase “null hypothesis” refers to the fact that null hypotheses are statements of no difference, or equality.
(ii) Alternative Hypothesis This is a statement that stands in opposition to the null hypothesis; it specifies what forms of departure from the null hypothesis are of potential concern.
It is symbolised as H and has the same form as the 1 corresponding null hypothesis except that the equality sign is replaced ≠,> or <.
In many applications, the alternative hypothesis embodies an investigator’s suspicions and/or hopes about the true state of affairs, amounting to a kind of research hypothesis that the investigator tends to establish.
A full specification of hypothesis test must be one of the followings: (i) H :m =a ; H : m <a (one-sided) => lower tail test 0 1 (ii) H :m =a ; H : m >a (one-sided) => upper tail test 0 1 (iii) H :m =a ; H : m ≠a (two-sided) => two tail test 0 1 The sidedness of a test is the direction specified by the alternative hypothesis H indicating the direction of a further choice of a new H 1 0 should the current one be rejected.
A health researcher wishes to study whether vitamin E deficiency affects the storage of vitamin A in rats.
He feeds ten rats a diet deficient in vitamin E and then measures the amount of vitamin A in the liver of each rat and obtained the data in the table below: 82 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Rat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Number Vitamin 3142 2134 2037 1700 1350 2170 3080 2010 2123 3014 A The researcher has done a great deal of research with rats, and he knows from his experience that with a normal diet, the average amount of vitamin A is very close to 3,200 and that the standard deviation is very close to 500.
He wants to decide on the basis of his data, if very insufficient vitamin E has changed the mean amount of vitamin A, or whether the mean under the deficient diet is the same as for rats under the normal diet.
He then formulates a null hypothesis which he proposes to test: i.e.
the mean of a population of amounts of vitamin A in the liver of rats who are fed a diet deficient in vitamin E is 3,200.
On the basis of his data, he wishes either to accept the null hypothesis or to reject the null hypothesis.
His null hypothesis is equivalent to saying that the deficient diet has no effect, on the average, on the amount of vitamin A in the liver of rats i.e.
H :m =3,200 0 H : m <3,200 1 3.2 Test Statistics (TS) This is the particular form of numerical data summarisation to be used in a hypothesis test.
The formula for the test statistics typically involves the number appearing in the null hypothesis.
The essence of test statistics in hypothesis test is a function of sampled data whose magnitude determines the acceptance or rejection of the H under test.
0 The table below shows the distributions and their respective conditions: Condition Distribution/TS Case 1 Test for mean, known variance, normal x- m Z = distribution or large sample i.e.
>30 s / n Case 2 Test for mean, large sample, variance x- m Z = unknown s/ n (x+0.5)- l Case 3 Z = l Large mean,l ,Poisson distribution When 0.5 is the continuity 83  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS x- m Case 4 T = Test for mean, small sample i.e n£ 30, s/ l With n-1 degree of variance unknown freedom p- p Case 5 2 = pq Test for proportion, large sample size n 3.2.1 Rejection Region (RR) or Critical Region The rejection region of a test is a set on the real number line specified in such a way that whenever the numerical value of the test statistics falls into this region, the H is rejected and accepted if the numerical value of 0 the test statistics falls outside the region.
Generally, rejection region or critical region refers to the set of values that lead to the rejection of H in favour of H while, the set of values o 1 that leads to the acceptance of Ho is the acceptance region.
The figures below show the region to be accepted or rejected or rejected depending on the sidedness of the test: Two-tailed Test Upper-tailed Tests Lower-tailed Tests 3.2.2 Errors in Hypothesis Test i.
Types 1 Error This is the possibility of deciding in favour of H whenin fact H is true.
1 O It is committed when a true hypothesis H is rejected when it ought to 1 have been accepted.
84 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS ii.
Type II Error This is the possibility of deciding in favour of H when in fact H is true.
0 1 It is committed when an alternative hypothesis is rejected when it ought to have been accepted.
The content of the two definitions above is conveniently represented in the table below: Our Decision Reality H correct We accept H correct We reject H , Type I Error 0 O 0 H in correct Type II error Correct 0 3.2.3 Significance Level of a test: a This is the probability that H is nevertheless rejected in favour of H 0 1 when the population parameter has the value specified by H .
It is the O maximum probability of committing type one error when the null hypothesis holds.
It is typically represented by a 3.2.4 Outlined Steps in Hypothesis Tests 1.
Write down the two hypotheses e.g.
H :m = m ;m ;H :m < m 0 0 0 1 0 2.
Determine the appropriate test-statistic to be used and the distribution of the corresponding random variable 3.
Determine the significance level of the test.
4.
Decide on the distribution of the test statistics and the sidedness of the test i.e.
whether single or double.
5.
By using the significance level of the test sidedness of the test and the distribution of the test statistics, decide the boundary or boundaries of the rejection region.
6.
Give the decision rule i.e.
whether to accept or reject H 0 Example 11 A random sample of size 35 selected from a population whose distribution is normal with mean m and variance 36 gives a sample mean 48.
Test the hypothesis H : m = 50 against the sample mean 48.
Test the O hypothesis H : m < 50 at 5% level of significance.
0 Solution Here, n > 30 i.e.
n = 35 and the variance s 2is known i.e.
s 2 = 36⇒ s = 6 85  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Step 1: H :m =50 O H : m < 50 o Step 2: x- m T.S.
= s / n 48- 50 = 6/ 35 = 1.972 Step 3: a = 5% Step 4: Since the alternative hypothesis is H :m < 50 it is a lower tailed test.
0 Step 5: 0.05 1.972 -1.645 0 5% = 0.05 \ 0.5 - 0.05 = 0.45 Check this value under the body of your normal distribution table gives p-value \ p-value = -1.645 \ The p-value = 1.645.
Since this is a lower tailed test a minus sign is assigned to it.
Conclusion The test-statistic falls within the rejection region, therefore, H is rejected 0 and H is accepted.
Then, we conclude that m < 50 1 86 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Example 12 A random sample of size 40 selected from a normal population with mean m and a standard deviation 4 gives a sample mean of 36, Test the hypothesis H :m > = 30 against H : m > 30 at 6% level of significance.
0 1 Solution n = 40, s =4 x = 36 , a = 6% x- m The T.S = z = s / n 36- 30 = 4/ 40 = 9.49 since H : m > 30 this is upper-tailed test 1 6% a = 6% = 0.06 \ 0.5 -0.06 = 0.44 Check this value under normal table gives \ p-value = 1.555 Conclusion The test-statistic falls within the rejection region.
We therefore reject H 0 and conclude that u.
> 30 at 6% significance level.
Example 13 A random sample of size 50 selected from a normal distribution N (m , 4) population gives a sample mean of 20.
Test the hypothesis H : m = 21.5 0 against the alternative hypothesis H: m „ 21.5 at 5% level of I significance.
Solution n= 50, s 2 = 4 ⇒s = 2, x = 20 , a = 5% x- m The T.S.
= z = s / n 87  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 20- 21.5 = 1/ 50 = - 5.3 Since H : m „ 21.5 this is a two-sided test 1 a / = 0.025 % = 0.025 2 -5.3 -1.96 0 +1.96 +5.3 Since it is a two-sided test, the RR consists of two parts i.e.
the lower and the upper-tails.
Then, a is shared between the two parts a a = 5% ⇒ = 0.025 2 \ 0.5-0.025 = 0.475 Check this value under the body of your normal distribution table gives \ p-value = 1.96 Conclusion The test-statistics fails within the rejection regions.
We then reject H and 0 accept H and then conclude that m „ 21.5.
I Example 14 A random sample of 6 observations taking from a population whose distribution is normal with mean m and unknown variance s 2 gives the following observations 6, 4, 10, 2, 8, 5.
Test the hypothesis H :m = 6.5 O against the alternative hypothesis H : m <6.5 at 5% level of significance.
I Solution Variance unknown, n=6 i.e.
small sample then t-distribution is used ∑ x = 6 + 4+ 10+2+8+5 = 35 ∑x2 = 62 + 42 + 102 + 22 + 82 + 52 = 245 ∑ x \ x = _ n 88 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 35 = = 5.833 6 (∑x)2 (35)2 ∑x2 - 245- s2 = n = 6 n- 1 6- 1 = 8.167 \ s = 8.167 = 2.858 x- m 5.833- 6.5 T.S = t = = s/ n 2.858 6 = 0.572 -2.02 -0.572 5% = 0.05 \ 1-0.5 = 0.95 The p-value = t a ,n- 1 = t 5%,n- 1 = t 1-0.05,n-1 = t 0.95,6-1 =t 0.96,n-1 2.02 (since this is a lower tailed test = minus is assigned to the p-value i.e.
= - 2.02) Conclusion The test-statistics falls within the acceptance region, we then accept H and reject H and conclude that the mean m = 6.5 0 I Example 15 The farm manager of "Adebowale Farm" wishes to determine whether eggs sold as size I have mean weight 70.0g, he weighs a ∑ sample of 200 eggs and his results are summarised by x = 13824, ∑x2 = 957320 where x is the weight of an egg in grams.
Test whether there is significant evidence, at the 3% level, that the mean weight is not 70.0g.
89  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Solution n = 200 Unknown variance H : m = 70g o H : m „ 70g 1 ∑ x x = n 13824 = = 69.12 200 (∑x)2 ∑x2 - n s2 = n- 1 (13824)2 957320- 200 = 200- 1 S2 = 9.071 \ s = 3.012 x- m T.S = z = s/ n 69.12- 70 = 3.012 200 = -4.132 Since m „ 70g this is a 2-tailed test 0.015 0.015 The 0.5 – 0.015 = 0.485 \ Check this value under the body of your normal distribution table gives: p-value = 2.17 i.e.
±2.17 Conclusion The test-statistics fails within the rejection region, we then reject H and 0 accept H and therefore conclude that m „ =70g i.e.
the mean weight is 1 not equal to 70g which means it could be greater than or less than 70.0g.
90 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Example 16 The time taken for cessation of bleeding was recorded for a large number of persons whose fingers had been pricked.
The mean time was found to be s 2 minutes and the standard deviation was a2 minutes.
In an effort to determine whether pressure applied to the upper arm increases bleeding time, three persons had pressure equal to 20mm, applied to their upper arms and their fingers pricked.
For these three persons, the times taken for bleeding to stop were 1.15, 1.75 and 2.50 minutes; test at 5% level of significance, whether the mean time is equal to 1.407 or not.
Solution n = 3 (small sample), variance unknown; H :m = 1.407 0 H : m „ 1.407 1 ∑x =1.15+1.75+2.50 = 5.4 ∑x2 = 1.152 + 1.752+2.502=10.635 ∑ x \ Mean x = n 5.4 = = 1.8 3 (∑x)2 ∑x2 - s2 = n n- 1 (5.4)2 10.635- 3 = 3- 1 S2 = 0.4575 \ s = 0.6764 x- m 1.8- 1.407 T.S = t = = =1.0064 s/ n 0.6764 3 5% = 0.05 \ 1-0.5 = 0.95 i.e p-value = t a ,n- 1 = t 5%,n-1 = t 0.975,2 = 4.30 91  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Conclusion Since the test-statistics falls within the acceptance region, we therefore accept H and reject H and then, conclude that the mean time o I is equal to 1.407.
Example 18 In a public opinion poll, 1000 randomly chosen electors were asked whether they would vote for Party “A” at the next election and 357 replied “Yes”.
The leader of the party believes that the true proportion is 0.4. test, at the 8% level, whether he is overestimating his support.
Solution n 100, r=357, ^ r \ p = n 357 = = 0.357 100 The hypothesis Ho: p=0.4 H : P< 0.4 1 ^ p- p \ z = pq n 0.357- 0.4 = 0.4x0.6 1000 = -2.78 8% = 0.08 \ 0.5-0.08 = 0.42 Check this value under the body of your normal distribution table gives p- value = 1.453 Conclusion The null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted, then the proportion p< 0.4; therefore the leader of the party is over estimating his support.
92 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.3 Tests on the Differences between Two Means If the researcher asks the question, “Is the mean amount of vitamin A for rats on the deficient diet the same as the mean amount for rats on the normal diet?” He then decides to take 20 rats and divides them at random into two groups: to one group he gives the normal diet and to the other group he gives the deficient diet.
He obtains two sets of data, each consisting of 10 amounts of vitamin A, and computes their mean x and x for the normal and deficient diet-group.
He now calculates the 1 2 difference between the computed means i.e.
x - x 1 2 The problem is to decide whether their difference is large enough to convince him that there really is a difference between amounts of vitamin A under the two diets, or whether the difference might have been caused by sampling variation.
The form of the hypothesis test for comparing the means of two population or difference of means depends on whether or not the population variances are known or not.
3.4 Population Variance Known The hypothesis is: H : m = m or H : m -m = 0 o 1 2 o 1 2 H : m < m or H : m - m < 0 o 1 2 o 1 2 H : m > m or H : m - m > 0 o 1 2 o 1 2 H : m „ m or H :m - m „ 0 o 1 2 o 1 2 Let X and Y be the two random variables with mean m ,m and x y variances s 2,s 2 respectively.

Example 19 A random sample of 85 observations is taken from a population with standard deviation 10.2 and the sample mean is 31.2.
A random sample of 72 observations is taken from a second population with standard 94 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS deviation 15.8 and the sample mean is 35.5.

the second population does not have a greater mean than the first.

The hypothesis can be compared to a level of significance.
If the p-value is smaller thana , the level of significance, the test results are considered to be significant and the null hypothesis is rejected; if larger, the null hypothesis is not rejected.
The rejection of a true null hypothesis is a Type I error.
Not rejecting a false null hypothesis is a Type II error.

One year is chosen as the reference year and scaled to 100.
All other figures are scaled so that the ratio of the index number to 100 is the same as the ratio of that original value to the value in the year under reference.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of the unit, you should be able to: • explain an index number • describe several uses of price index and the meaning of consumer price index • construct indexes (price, value e.t.c.).
102 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 What Is An Index Number?
Index numbers are descriptive statistics.
We are all aware that prices, for example, vary from time to time and from place to place.
A price index number is useful to describe the way in which prices vary from one time to another or from one place to another.
There are many other forms of index numbers besides price indexes.
Industrial output, farm output, unemployment, employment, and highway accidents vary from time to time and from place to place.
Any of these can be measured and described with an appropriate index number.
Index numbers are used in many situations.
A firm choosing a new plant location may be interested in the price of consumer goods, which might be an important factor in determining the wage rates necessary for a given location.
An organisation interested in promoting highway safety might be interested in an index of highway accidents to determine where a safety campaign should be instituted.
A person seeking a retirement home might be interested in the price of consumer goods in various places to aid in determining where to live after retirement.
There are many other uses for index numbers.
3.2 Simple Price Index A price index (plural: “price indices” or “price indexes”) is a normalised average (typically a weighted average) of prices for a given class of goods or services in a given region, during a given interval of time.
It is a statistical design which helps to compare how these prices, taken as a whole, differ between time periods or geographical locations.
Price indices have several potential uses.
For particularly broad indices, the index can be said to measure the economy's price level or a cost of living.
More narrow price indices can help producers with business plans and pricing.
Sometimes, they can be useful in helping to guide investment.
A number of different formulas, at least hundreds, have been proposed as means of calculating price indexes.
While price index formulas all use price and quantity data, they amalgamate this data in different ways.
A price index generally aggregates using various combinations of base period prices (p ), later period prices (p), base period quantities (q ), and 0 t 0 later period quantities (q).
Price index formulas can be framed as t comparing expenditures (expenditure is a price multiplied by a quantity) or taking a weighted average of price relatives (p / p ).
t 0 103  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.3 Construction of Index Numbers Now that a price index has been constructed, it may be helpful to state in symbols what has already been accomplished in the preceding section.
Using the symbol p to stand for the price of a commodity, the subscript n to represent the year under consideration (called the given year), the subscript 0 to indicate the base year, and the symbol q to stand for the quantity of a commodity bought or sold, we can restate the index number calculations.
To combine these simple price indexes into a price index using the base year value of transactions as weights, the index is constructed as: p ∑ n (p q ) p O o O X100 ∑ p q O o Where the summation sign indicates a summation over all commodities included in the index.
(For historical purposes, this particular form of price index is called the Laspeyres price index, named after the person influential in its development).
If some typical market basket is selected for weighting the simple price indexes, the index number is computed as: p ∑ n (p q ) p O t O X100 ∑ p q O t Where the subscript t denotes the typical quantity bought or sold for that commodity.
3.4 Value, Quantity and Geographical Indexes There are several other useful indexes.
For example, consider a retail store that sells two products: cross-country motorcycles and bicycles.
The store is interested in looking at the changes in its volume of sales over the past several years.
If prices have changed over this time period, a very important question is whether the firm is interested in looking at changes in the naira value of sales, or in changes in the number of physical units sold.
The first question, the change in naira value of sales, is addressed by constructing a value index.
The second question, changes in physical volume of sales, is addressed by constructing a quantity index.
The firm's records yielded the information shown in Table 1.
104 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Table 1: Sales of Motorcycles and Bicycles Bicycles Motorcycles Number sales Number Total selling selling sales Year sold revenue sold Sales(N) price price revenue(N) (N) (N) (N) 1976 300 100 30,000 50 20 1,000 31,000 1977 320 110 35,200 80 25 2,000 37,200 1978 260 90 23,400 130 35 4,550 27,950 1979 200 105 21,000 140 30 4,200 25,250 1980 270 120 32,400 120 35 4,200 36,600 3.5 Value Index A value index is nothing more than the ratio of the naira volume of sales in the given year to the naira volume of sales in the base year (with the usual factor of 100, arising because index numbers are implicitly stated as percentages).
For the data given inTable1 the value index is computed in Table 2.
From Table 2 it is apparent that 1978 sales, for example, were 90.2 percent of 1976 sales.
Table 2: Value Index for a Motorcycle and Bicycle Shop (1976 = 100) 1976 31,00/3131,000x100 = 100.0 1977 37,200/31,000x100= 120.0 1978 27,950/31,000x100=90.2 1979 25,200/31,000x100=81.3 1980 36,600/31,000x100=118.1 In equation form, the value index is computed as ∑ p q n n x100 ∑ p q O o It is important to note that a value index combines changes in both prices and quantity of transactions into one figure.
3.6 Quantity Index If the owner of the bicycle and motorcycle shop is interested in describing changes in the physical volume of sales, apart from the naira volume of sales, a quantity index should be computed.
The first step in computing this index is to compute the simple index of quantities for 105  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS each of the individual commodities, bicycles and motorcycles.
These simple indexes are computed in Table 3.
To combine these two simple quantity indexes into one quantity index, it is necessary to weight each commodity by its importance.
For this problem, the store owner (or the statistical analyst) must make a decision about the appropriate importance of bicycles and motorcycles.
Table 3: Simple Quantity Indexes: Bicycles and Motorcycle (1976 = 100) Year Bicycles Motorcycles 1976 300/300x100 = 100.0 50/50 x 100 = 100.0 1977 320/300x100 = 106.7 80/50 x 100 = 160.0 1978 260/300x100 = 86.7 130/50 x 100 = 260.0 1979 200/300x100 = 66.7 140/50 x 100 = 280.0 1980 270/300x100 = 90.0 120/50 x 100 = 240.0 Table 4: Quantity index for bicycle –motorcycle shop, based on judgmental weight (1976 = 100) Year Bicycles Motorcycles index 1976 0.9 x 100.0 + 0.1 x 100.0 = 100.0 1977 0.9 x 106.7 + 0.1 x 100.0 = 112.0 1978 0.9 x 86.7 + 0.1 x 260.0 = 104.0 1979 0.9 x 66.7 + 0.1 x 280.0 = 88.0 1980 0.9 x 90.0 + 0.1 x 240.0 = 105.0 1976, motorcycles contributed only about 3 percent of naira sales, while in 1979 motorcycle amounted to nearly 17 percent of naira sales.
If the owner of the shop felt that typical sales figures for the store were 90 percent bicycles and 10 percent motorcycles, these weights could be used in constructing the quantity index.
Of course, it is possible to use any other set of weights, such as 1976 values, 1980 values, or some average of values for various years.
Using the store owner's judgmentally determined 90 percent versus 10 percent weights, the quantity index is shown in Table 4.
From this table, it is apparent that there has been a substantial decline in physical volume of sales from 1977 to 1978 and 1979.
It is also apparent that the value index of 118.1 for 1980 does not represent changes in physical volume alone.
Although the naira volume in 1980 was 118.1 percent of the naira volume in 1976 (Table 2), the physical 106 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS quantity of merchandise passing through the doors increased only to an index of 105.0.
The formula for computing a quantity index may be expressed as: q ∑ nwX100 q o Where the symbol w denotes the weight appropriate for a particular commodity, and the sum of the weights is one.
If base year naira values are used as weights, the quantity index (a Laspeyres quantity index) is q ∑ n (p q ) q O o O X100 ∑ p q O o Values for other years could be used as weights.
3.7 Geographical Price Index Price indexes discussed so far reflect price changes over the time at the same location.
Prices may also vary from place to place at the same time.
For simplicity, let us consider price indexes for two cities, A and B, for the year 1981.
This simplified example will assume only three commodities: transportation, housing and food.
The example is further simplified by assuming that only one price exists for each commodity in each city.
The raw data are shown in Table 5.
It is apparent by now that the construction of an index number requires weights.
Suppose consumer expenditure studies in each city reveal the proportion of expenditures for each commodity in each city, as shown in Table 6.
Suppose a soon-to-retire worker is interested in whether prices are higher in A or B.
However, the worker needs to answer the question, "The price of what?"
if the worker is interested.
Table 5: Data for Price Index in two Cities (price per unit) City Transportation Housing food A N58,9 N195 N1.89 B N51.9 N235 N1.92 107  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Table 6: Proportion of expenditure for each commodity City transportation housing food A 0.30 0.45 0.25 B 0.35 0.25 0.40 In the price in city B of the “market basket” of city A, the expenditure proportions for city A are used to weight the price of city B relative to city A: p ∑ B w p A Price index in city B for the market basket of city A = A X100 ∑ w A Where W is the relative importance of a commodity in city A, A A similar definition, with A and B reversed, gives the price index in city A for the market basket of city B.
These indexes are calculated below.
Price index in city B for market basket of city A: 51.9  235  1.92   x0.30+ x0.45+ x0.25x100 =106.1 58.9  195  1.89  Price index in city A for market basket of city B: 58.9  195  1.89   x0.35+ x0.25+ x0.40x100 = 99.8 51.9  235  1.92  These calculations indicate that prices in city B are higher than prices in city A.
More specifically, a resident of city A, who went to city B and purchased the "A" market basket, would pay 106.1 percent as much as for the same items in city A.
However, a resident of city B who went to city A and purchased the "B" market basket would pay 99.8 percent as much as for the same items in city B.
This seems to be saying that city B prices are about 6 percent higher than city A prices, but city A prices are about the same as city B prices!
The apparent contradiction arises because the market basket differs from city to city.
This differing market basket makes geographical price indexes par- ticularly difficult to construct.
A commodity that is very important in one city, such as home heating fuel in Fairbanks, is less important in another city.

3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Important Price Measures Many economic research organisations publish statistical data about many aspects of our economy.
Many of these data are expressed as index 111  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS numbers.
From a personal standpoint, the index number that directly affects most of us is the Consumer Price Index, which is often loosely called the “cost of living” index.
3.2 Consumer Price Index “The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure of changes, over a time, in the price of goods and services .
.
.
typically purchased by urban consumers.” The index is broken down into major expenditure groups, such as food and beverages, housing, apparel and upkeep, transportation, and others.
These major expenditure groups are then weighted to form the overall index.
The Consumer Price Index, in a form roughly comparable to current data, has been published since 1921.
Until 1978, the CPI measured price changes for urban wage earners and clerical workers.
Beginning in 1978, there have been two versions of the CPI.
The CPI-W measures price changes for urban wage earners and clerical workers, consistent with decades of CPI data.
The second version, CPI-U, measures price changes for all urban consumers.
The CPI-U is based on buying habits of about 80 percent of the civilian population of the United States.
The primary groups of consumers included in the CPI-U, but excluded in CPI-W, are the self-employed, professional, white-collar, salaried workers, retired persons, and the unemployed.
Because of these differences, the CPI-W covers only about half of the consumers covered by the CPI-U.
From a statistical standpoint, one of the most important uses of the CPI is to deflate another economic time series.
From an economist's point of view, an extremely important use of the CPI is to measure the effect of economic policy on price levels.
3.3 Quality Changes in the CPI One aspect that the index number should incorporate, if possible, is changes in the quality of goods included in the index.
Unfortunately, quality is a very difficult aspect to measure.
Are 1977 automobiles "better" than 1967 automobiles?
How are quality changes in gas mileage and safety features measured?
The index statistician needs to be aware of such changes in product composition while the index is being compiled.
The Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) explains its proce- dures: One of the most difficult conceptual problems faced in compiling a price index is accurate measurement and treatment of quality change because products and consumption patterns are constantly changing.
For example, with each model change of an automobile, the FBS faces the problem of separating the price rise from the increase in price due to quality change.
112 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Quality change in a new model of an item should not be reflected as a price change, since the index measures the cost to consumers of purchasing a constant market basket of goods and services of constant quality through time.
Ideally, estimates would be obtained for each naira value quality change resulting from a change in the model or item priced.
This estimate would reflect how much consumers value the quality change.
However, this direct measuring of quality change is extremely difficult since measurement of the value consumers place on quality change is rarely possible.
Therefore, to adjust for quality change, FBS uses an indirect method to measure the quality change by evaluating the additional cost associated with producing the change in quality.
For new automobile features, this estimate is based on all costs incurred in manufacturing plus the established company mark-up to the selling price of passenger cars.
This estimate of costs applies to all new features that are installed as standard equipment, that is, features on cars in the same or comparable series.
For all items that replace or modify some previously existing features, the estimate is based on the difference in cost between the old and the new features.
In other words, the estimate of cost for new items is computed for both the new and the old features.
The difference between these values is used as the estimate of quality change.
Adjustments for quality change in the CPI "new car" index include structural and engineering changes that affect safety, environment, reliability, performance, durability, economy, carrying capacity, manoeuvrability, comfort, and convenience.
Although, antipollution equipment on automobiles originally did not increase quality because the utility to the purchaser is difficult to determine, these devices do improve quality for consumers in general and therefore an increase in physical quality for the individual consumer.
Consequently, quality adjustments are made for pollution controls to automobiles.
Quality adjustments exclude changes in style or appearance, such as chrome trim, unless these features have been offered as options and purchased by a large proportion of customers.
Also, new technology sometimes results in better quality at reduced or no increase in cost.
When no satisfactory value has been developed for such a change, it is ignored, and prices are compared directly.
3.4 Applying the CPI to Deflate a Time Series Consider Table 1 on Mercantile Stores example below.
These data were reported in constant (1967) naira with a brief word description regarding the deflation of the actual sales to constant naira sales.
Selecting a 113  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS small series of quarterly sales figures for an example, the deflation of a part of this time series is demonstrated in Table 1.
The Apparel and Upkeep component of the CPI was used for the price index.
This is not a perfect choice, because Mercantile does not deal in upkeep (dry cleaning, etc.).
It also omits household furnishings (bedding, etc.)
which are a part of mercantile business.
Each index value used for deflation is the average of the index for the three months in that quarter.
The reader should note that sales in Column 1 are affected by changes in quantities and prices, whereas sales in Column 3 reflect changes in quantity only.
The sales in Column 1 are measures of values (i.e.
prices X quantities), whereas sales in Column 3 reflect quantities, but in naira units.
In general, sales in current naira (as in Column 1) constitute a time series of values, and sales in constant naira (as in Column 3) constitute a time series reflecting physical sales, not naira sales.
Table 1: Mercantile Stores Quarterly Sales and Apparel and Upkeep Price Index 1 2 3 Reported sales price index =1/2x100 Year Quarter N (current naira (1967 =100) Sales (1967 naira; millions) N millions) 1972 1 N87.4 121.3 N72.1 2 N100.0 121.9 N82.0 3 N112.4 122.7 N91.6 4 N158.5 124.3 N127.5 1973 1 N102.6 124.7 N82.3 2 N116.3 126.4 N92.0 3 N123.9 128.1 N96.7 4 175.3 129.9 N134.9 3.5 Producer Price Indexes Prices paid by consumers are measured by the Consumer Price Index.
Before it is purchased by a consumer, the price of a consumer item is measured by various Producer Price Indexes.
As an example, follow wheat through its production processes to flour, bread, and then consumption.
The price of wheat is included in the “Producer Price Index for crude materials for further processing.” After the wheat has been processed into flour, its price is included in the “Producer Price Index for intermediate goods.” After the flour has been processed into bread, its price is included in the "Producer Price Index for finished goods.” When the bread is purchased by a consumer, its price is in- 114 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS cluded in the CPI.
The Producer Price Indexes are published monthly, by Federal Bureau of Statistics.
They “measure average changes in prices received in primary markets of the United States by producers of commodities in all stages of processing.” The FBS emphasises three Producer Price Indexes, one for each of the three stages of production.
Producer Price Indexes are also available for commodity groupings, such as farm products, rubber and plastic products, and many other groupings.
With UK Producer Price Indexes, a manufacturer can compare changes in the prices paid or received with the national average price changes for similar commodities.
For example, there is a separate index available for the intermediate material “prepared paint.” This index shows the prices (relative to the base year) for prepared paint at the first important commercial transaction after manufacture, the price paid to a paint manufacturer.
A manufacturer of another commodity, such as household furniture, might be interested in comparing its prices (relative to the same base year) for prepared paint with the national index.
Thus, the prepared paint represents a selling price for the paint manufacturing industry and a purchase price for the household furniture industry.
In 1978 the FBS changed the name of the old Wholesale Price Index to the Producer Price Index for all commodities.
In using the various Producer Price Indexes, data are available for many past years.
How- ever, historical publications use the term Wholesale Price Index instead of the current title, Producer Price Index.
3.6 GDP Deflator The GDP deflator can be viewed as a measure of general inflation in the domestic economy.
Inflation can be described as a measure of price changes over the time.
The deflator is usually expressed in terms of an index, i.e.
a time series of index numbers.
Percentage changes on the previous year are also shown.
The GDP deflator reflects movements of hundreds of separate deflators for the individual expenditure components of GDP.
These components include expenditure on such items as bread, investment in computers, imports of aircraft and exports of consultancy services.
3.6.1 Uses of the GDP Deflator Series The GDP deflator allows for the effects of changes in price (inflation) to be removed from a time series, i.e.
it allows the change in the volume of goods and services to be measured.
The resultant series can be used to express a given time series or data set in real terms, i.e.
by removing price changes.
115  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.6.2 Measurement in National Accounts In most systems of national accounts the GDP deflator measures, the ratio of nominal (or current-price) GDP to the real (or chain volume) measure of GDP.
The formula used to calculate the deflator is: Nominal GDP GDP deflator = · 100 Real GDP Dividing the nominal GDP by the GDP deflator and multiplying it by 100 would then give the figure for real GDP, hence deflating the nominal GDP into a real measure.
It is often useful to consider implicit price deflators for certain subcategories of GDP, such as computer hardware.
In this case, it is useful to think of the price deflator as the ratio of the current-year price of a good to its price in some base year.
The price in the base year is normalised to 100.
For example, for computer hardware, we could define a “unit” to be a computer with a specific level of processing power, memory, and hard drive space and so on.
A price deflator of 200 means that the current-year price of this computing power, is twice its base-year price - price inflation.
A price deflator of 50 means that the current-year price is half the base year price - price deflation.
Unlike some price indexes, the GDP deflator is not based on a fixed basket of goods and services.
The basket is allowed to change with people's consumption and investment pattern.
(Specifically, for GDP, the "basket" in each year is the set of all goods that were produced domestically, weighted by the market value of the total consumption of each good.)
Therefore, new expenditure patterns are allowed to show up in the deflator as people respond to changing prices.
The advantage of this approach is that the GDP deflator reflects up to date expenditure patterns.
For instance, if the price of chicken increases relative to the price of beef, people would likely spend more money on beef as a substitute for chicken.
A fixed market basket measurement would miss this change.
In practice, the difference between the deflator and a price index like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is often relatively small.
On the other hand, with governments in developed countries increasingly utilising price indexes for everything from fiscal and monetary planning to payments to social programme recipients, the even small differences between inflation measures can shift budget revenues and expenses by millions or billions of naira.
116 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.7 Indexes of Quantity Output One of the more important indexes of industrial output for the entire economy is the Federal Reserve Board index of quantity output, more commonly called the index of industrial production.
Table 2: GNP in Current and Constant Naira, and Implicit Deflator 1 2 3 Year GNP , Current Naira GNP, constant Implicit Deflator (billion) Naira (billion) (1) ÷ (2) x 100 (1972 =100) 1960 N506.0 N736.8 N68.7 1961 N523.3 N755.3 N69.3 1962 N563.8 N799.1 N70.6 1963 N594.7 N830.7 N72.7 1964 N635.7 N874.4 N74.3 1965 N688.1 N925.9 N76.8 1966 N753.0 N981.0 N79.0 1967 N796.3 N1,007.7 N82.6 1968 N868.5 N1,051.8 N86.7 1969 N935.8 N1,078.8 N91.4 1970 N982.4 N1,075.3 N96.0 1971 N1,063.4 N1,107.5 N100.0 1972 N1,171.1 N1,171.1 N105.8 1973 N1,306.3 N1,235.0 N116.0 1974 N1,412.9 N1,217.8 N105.8 1975 N1,528.8 N1,202.3 N116.0 1976 N1,702.2 N1,273.0 N127.2 1977 N1,899.6 N1,340.5 N133.7 1978 N141.7 N1,399.2 N152.1 It measures changes in the physical volume or quantity of output of manufacturers, minerals, and electric and gas utilities.
The index does not cover production on farms, in the construction industry, in transportation, or in the various trade and service industries.
The index reflects output changes at all stages of production.
As with other indexes we have examined, the index of industrial production is broken into many components.
For example, there are separate indexes available for automotive products, which are further broken into subcategories.
Output indexes are also available for car- peting and furniture, appliances, TV, and furniture, primary metals, 117  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS fabricated metal products, machinery, transportation equipment, lumber and so on.
With this kind of detailed information, a firm is able to compare its own output over time with the appropriate industry index of output, to determine how its own growth compares with the national average.
From an investor's standpoint, the index also provides information about the relative growth of various product groups or industries.
As are other indexes, the index of industrial production is revised periodically to reflect changes in the economy.
For example, a revision in 1971 incorporated information to match the index series to bench marks obtained in the Annual Survey of Manufacturers.
An earlier revision was completed in 1962.
Another useful index of output can be constructed from gross national product data.
The GNP is "the market value of the output of goods and services produced by the nation's economy.
"9 This series is one of the more widely used measures of the output of the entire economy- The time series of GNP can easily be expressed as an index, simply by dividing the value for each year by the value of GNP for the base year.
This computation, showing 1967 as the base year, is shown in Table 3.
This index is a value index, rather than a measure of the aggregate physical output of the economy.

GNP constant naira values are used to produce an output index.
This computation is demonstrated in Table3.
Just as there were various price indexes to measure various price changes, we have not seen two quantity indexes to measure different kinds of output changes.
The GNP in constant naira, expressed as an index, is a much broader-based output index than the Federal Reserve Board index of industrial production.
Two important sectors of the economy covered by GNP, but omitted in the Federal Reserve Board index, are agriculture and services.
3.8 Productivity Indexes Productivity is important to any economy.
Labour productivity is really nothing more than output per labour-hour.
If a measure of output is available, this output may be divided by the labour input (usually expressed in hours).
This quotient, expressed as an index, is a measure of changes in labour productivity.
To construct a productivity index for a particular firm (or industry), it is necessary only to divide a measure of output for that industry (such as a quantity index) by the amount of input of the factor of production whose productivity is being computed.
As an example, the owner of the bicycle-ski shop could easily compute the productivity of the labour force of the shop by dividing the output index from Table 4 by the number of labour hours used in each of the years.
Table 4: Labour productivity for the bicycle-ski shop (1976 = 100) 1 2 3 Labor productivity Year index hours output Labour (1) ÷ (2) (3) ÷ 0.0200 x 100 index Hour 1976 N100.0 N5,000 N0.0200 N100.0 1977 N112.0 N5,200 N0.0215 N107.5 1978 N104.0 N5,400 N0.0193 N95.5 1979 N88.0 N4,600 N0.0191 N95.5 1980 N105.0 N4,800 N0.0219 N109.5 Figure 4 also shows the index of labour productivity for the five years for which data are available.
This index could then be compared with 119  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS published indexes of labour productivity to provide information useful to the manager of the firm.

The price data are collected for a sample of goods and services from a sample of sales outlets in a sample of locations for a sample of times.
The weighting data are estimates of the shares of the different types of expenditure as fractions of the total expenditure covered by the index.
These weights are usually based upon expenditure data obtained for sampled decades from a sample of households.
The index is usually computed yearly, or quarterly in some countries, as a weighted average of sub-indices for different components of consumer expenditure, such as food, housing, clothing, each of which is in turn a weighted average of sub-sub-indices at the most detailed level, the elementary aggregate level.
The index reference period, usually called the base year, often differs both from the weight-reference period and the price reference period.
This is just a matter of rescaling the whole time-series to make the value for the index reference-period equal to 100.
Annually revised weights are a desirable but expensive feature of an index, for the older the 121  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS weights the greater is the divergence between the current expenditure pattern and that of the weight reference period.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain index numbers • describe the steps to be considered before the construction of index number • explain how to deflate a series using a retail price index.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 What are Index Numbers?
This can be defined as a statistical method of measuring a variable or a group of related variables with respect to its value at a particular period of time.
This specified period of time is called the base period.
Products, such as petroleum, cash crops etc.
are examples of group related variables.
If the above mentioned variables are with respect to price, then it is called price index.
Also, if they are with respect to quality or volume, they are called quantity index.
Although, a typical index number may be concerned with whole sale prices, number of exported good, volume of production e.t.c.
Advantages of Index Number Actually, indices are widely used as summaries of change in financial contexts by agents, government and industries.
Index number is imperative in business and economic situation because of the following reasons.
• It measures the changes in prices, production, standard and cost of living etc.
• It helps in comparing related items from year to year, from country to country etc.
• It enables us to predict or forecast business and economic conditions at a specified time.
• It provides or shows a clear picture of the changes in a variable with respect to time.
• It provides general information.
122 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Steps to be considered before the construction of an index number i.
The significance of the index.
The reasons for putting up the index must be considered and carefully defined.
ii.
Choice of the items in the basket.
It is always difficult while constructing index number to include all items due to time and implications.
Hence, a sample must be taken and must not be biased.
iii.
Choice weights.
Weight means the importance or significance attached to the construction of index number and hence, its choice must be considered.
iv.
Choice of base period should be a period when things are stable and normal e.g.
the base period must not be chosen when there is existence of isolated natural occurrences such as war, flood earthquake, famine, poor weather e.t.c.
3.2 Method of Computation The nature, data availability and the scope of index number determine the method to be used for computation.
Price Relative Index (PRI) This is the percentage ration of the price of an item or a commodity in current period to the price in earlier specified or reference period.
P PRI = n X100 P O Where P is the price for the current period n P is the price for the base period.
o Quantity Relative Index This is the percentage ratio of the quantity of an item or a commodity in current period to the quantity in earlier specified or reference period.
123  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS q QRI = n X100 q O Where q is the quantity for the current period n q is the quantity for the base period.
o Example 1 The prices of a television set in 1996 and 1997 were N15, 000 and N20, 000 respectively.
Calculate: The price relative index • using 1996 as the base year • using 1997 as the base year Solution P = N15, 000 P = N20,000 1996 1997 P PRI = n · 100 P O P 20,000 PRI = 1997 · 100= · 100 P 15,000 1996 = 133.3% This means there has been an increase of 33.3% over the 1996 price.
P 15,000 PRI = 1996 · 100= · 100 P 20,000 1997 = 75% This means that there is a decrease of 25% in 1996 when 1997 was computed.
Example 2 The table shows the cost of a ‘mudu’ of four types of food items in a given year.
124 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Calculate the price relative using 1990 as the base year.
Food items 1990 1991 1992 yam flour 60 70 85 gari 80 90 120 beans 120 180 210 rice 200 250 300 Solution Since the base period is 1990.
Then the price of all the food items is 100%.
For 1991 70 90 Yam Flour = · 100=116.7% Gari= · 100=112.5% 60 80 180 250 Beans= · 100=150% Rice = · 100=125% 120 200 For 1992 85 120 Yam Flour = · 100=141.7% Gari= · 100=150% 60 80 210 300 Beans= · 100=175% Rice = · 100=150% 120 200 Food items 1990 1991 1992 yam flour 100 116.7 141.7 gari 100 112.5 150 beans 100 150 175 rice 100 125 150 3.3 Simple Price Index (SPI) This can be defined as the ratio of the prices of a group of related items in a given year to the sum of the price of the items in a base year.
This can be expressed mathematically as: ∑ P SPI = n · 100 ∑ P o ∑ q QPI = n · 100 ∑ q o 125  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Example 3 Compute the simple price index of the data in the table below using 1995 as the base year.

Simple Relative Price Index (SRPI) This is basically designed to control the effects or inadequacies of the simple price index which is affected by their extreme values and units.

3.4 Weighted Price Index This corrects the inadequacies and limitations of simple aggregate and simple average relative methods since both methods do not take consideration of the relative importance of the various items and assume equal weight of items.
Advantages of Weighted Price Index • It caters for the quantity of each commodity in order to weigh the price of each item.
128 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS • It uses the quantities in the base year as the weight or the quantity in the current year as the weight.
Weighted Mean of Relatives This is otherwise called weighted average of relatives and the method involves computing index relative for each of the given item and using the weights given to determine a weighted mean of relative for the data.
This can be mathematically expressed as: ∑ W I WAI (Weighted Average Index) = i i ∑ W i Where WI is the weighting factor.
‘I’ depends on either the price of the commodity or the quantity involved.
P Then I = n x 100 (for price) P o q I = n x 100 (for quantity) q o Illustration Imagine you are running a café and that you offer your customers when they order coffee, a choice from four different locations in Lagos i.e.
Victoria Island, Festac Town, Yaba and Ikeja.
You charge the same amount irrespective of the coffee chosen; your task is to ascertain how much it is likely to cost you to provide this service to your customers.
Once this is known, you will be able to decide how much you should charge a customer for coffee.
Your coffee suppliers volunteer the information that the four coffees sell in the ratio 4: 6 : 2 : 1 and cost N48, N15, N72, N28 per 100g respectively.
This information is sufficient to establish the likely average cost of a cup of coffee.
The data values are the price that you have to pay for 100 g, the ratios can be considered to be relative frequencies or, in this context, ‘weights’.
129  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Then, the ∑WI 4x40 + 6x15 + 2x72 + 1x28 WAI (Weighted Average Index) = i i = ∑W 4 + 6 + 2 + 1 i 454 = = 34.9 13 Interpretation It is going to cost on average N34.92 to purchase 100g of the customer’s choice of coffee.

In order to overcome this, ‘real prices’ or ‘money value’ are determined by deflating the original series.
This can be done by effectively changing the money values at one point in time, the base time, and so making the figures directly comparable.
Example 10 The table below shows the average weekly pay and the Retail Price Index (RPI), from 1995 through 1999.
137  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Year Average Weekly Wage ’000 (N) RPI 1995 72.30 168.2 1996 76.42 189.63 1997 83.96 198.24 1998 104.35 210.24 1999 115.76 230.34 By deflating the series, determine the rise in purchasing power of an individual from 1995 to 1999.
Solution The real value of earning in relation to 1995 can be computed as RPI for 1995 = Average wage for the year x RPI for the year and so on.
168.2 For 1995 a deflated figure is = 72.30 x = 72.30 168.2 168.2 1996 a deflated figure is = 76.42 x = 67.78 189.63 168.

This may be as a result of inflation.
The best way of judging the real value of a particular item or thing is to ask what else could be bought with the same amount of money.
If this has increased, then we say the original item has increased in value.
3.12 Retail Price Index (RPI) This is often used to know the relative change in value of an item.
This is based on a weighted combination of the prices of a 'basket' of commodities.
Then, a commodity holds its value if its apparent value rises in step.
Example 11 The information in the table below gives the January prices of chocolate for the years 1995-2000 together with the changing retail price index values, where January 1995 is considered as the base year.
Chocolate Price Year RPI (in N) 1995 100.0 79.5 1996 107.2 98 1997 110.3 98 1998 115.3 87 1999 123.1 95 2000 132.2 99 • Is there any year that chocolates were more expensive?
• What was the real price of chocolates given the cost of living?
139  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Solution The RPI has risen from 100 to 132.2 over the 5 year period Increase 132.2 -100 Percentage Increase = x100= x100=32.2% Actual value 100 This means that prices generally have risen by nearly one third during this period, (this is called inflation).
If the individual salary has increased exactly in proportion to the RPI, would the person be able to buy more chocolates with the money earned in 2000 than he could in 1995?
The question is simply answered by converting the chocolates price into indices, with the 1995 price being indexed to 100.

Nominal variables are measured without adjusting for any changes in the value of the currency in which the variable is measured.
Real variables are adjusted for changes in the currency’s value.
Simply put, real variables are adjusted so that increases due solely to the ballooning effects of inflation are removed from their values.
In order to capture meaningful changes in microeconomics, economists rely upon inflation-adjusted or real variables.
Nominal values often provide misleading information.
For example, for several years after the breakup of the former Soviet Union, many newly independent transition nations reported nominal GDP values that increased from year to year, often significantly.
However, when adjusted for the effects of inflation, the real GDP figures showed a much different picture.
Real GDP per capita is a key measure of economic growth for a country.
It represents the inflation-adjusted value of goods and services available on average 143  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS per citizen in a nation.
This often serves as a proxy measure for average standard of living, although there are problems associated with this interpretation.
The GDP deflator, which is a form of price index, is used to convert nominal gross domestic product values to real GDP.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define real and nominal values • differentiate between real and nominal values • identify the pitfalls between real and nominal values • change nominal to real values.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 Review of Real and Nominal Values A nominal value is expressed in the country’s currency at the time of measurement.
A real value is a nominal value that has been adjusted for changes in the value of the currency.
Suppose for example, the nominal price of bread bun was N 20 in 1980 and N 1.50 in 2005.
In the twenty- five years between 1980 and 2005, the purchasing power of the naira has changed because of changes in the average price level.
In order to measure the real price of bread, the nominal price of bread would need to be adjusted by a price index that captures the changes in the average price level.
Economists do not consider nominal variables to be of great interest because they include the distorting effects of higher prices and this factor masks whether actual real changes have occurred.
Thus, economists regularly use prices indexes to adjust the nominal values and forming real values.
Note: One of the most important macroeconomic variables used by economists and policy makers is real GDP.
Because economic well- being is measured, in part, by the goods and services individual citizens can purchase, it is important to convert nominal values for gross domestic product into real values that reflect the purchasing power of the currency.
The GDP deflator is a price index used for this purpose.
You should note that the GDP deflator is similar in nature to the CPI, although the goods covered and formulas are somewhat different.
144 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.2 Nominal and Real Variable The first row of Table 1 shows the average price of a new house, which rose from N2500 in 1960 to N124700 in 2000.
Are houses currently 50 times as expensive as in 1960?
Not when we allow for inflation which also raised incomes and the ability to buy houses.
The second row of Table 1 shows the retail price index, using 2000 as the base year, inflation led to substantial increase in the RPI, during 1960-2000.
The third row of table 1 calculates an index of rent house prices, expressed in 2000 in the top and bottom row.
To calculate the rent price of house in 1960, by expressing them at 2000 prices, we take the nominal price of N2, 500 and multiply by (100)/7.4) to allow for subsequent inflations, yield N33, 800.
Rent prices have roughly tripled since 1960 (from N33, 800 to N124, 700).
Most of the increase in nominal house prices in the top row of Table 1 was due to inflations.
1960 1980 2000 House price (000s) 2.5 27.2 124.7 RPI (2000= 100) 7.4 39.3 100.0 Rent price of house (2000) 33.8 69.2 124.7 3.2.1 Difference between Real or Relative Prices The distinction between nominal and real variables applies to all variable measured in money values.
It does not apply to units of output, such as 4000 carpets per annum, which relate to physical quantities.
Whatever the inflation rate, 4000 carpets are 4000 carpets.
However, we do not know whether N100 is a large or a small number until we know the general price level for goods.
The argument comes over to prices themselves.
The nominal price of solver has risen a lot since 1970.
To calculate the index of the rent price of solver, divide an index of nominal solver prices by the real price index of economic scarcity.
They show whether the price of a commodity rose faster than its price in general.
Hence, real prices are sometimes called relative price.
Consider the price of television over the last 30 years.
TV prices, measured in pounds, have hardly changed.
The RPI has risen a lot.
The real price of TVs has fallen.
Advances in technology reduced the cost of producing television sets.
Because the real price has fallen, many households now have several.
It is misleading to base our analysis on nominal values of variables.
145  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.3 The Purchasing Power of Money The PPM is an index of the quantity of goods that can be bought for N1.
To distinguish real and nominal variable we say that real variable measure nominal variables as if the purchasing power of money had been constant.
Another way to express this idea is to distinguish nominal variable in current naira and rent variables in constant naira.
Table 1 described real prices of houses measured in 2000 naira.
We could of course have used 1960 naira instead.
Although the level of the real price index for houses would have been different, it would have grown at exactly the same rate as the final row of table 1.
3.4 Real and Nominal Interest Rates: Inflated and Present Values Consider the table below.
The 1st column of table 2 shows rental receipts in actual naira.
The interest rate of 10 percent tells us how many actual naira we earn by lending N1 for a year.
At a nominal interest rate of 10 percent, N100 percent today accumulates to N110 by next year.
But we want to know how many goods that N110 will then buy.
Suppose the nominal interests rate is 10 percent but inflation is 6 percent; leaving N1 for a year gives N1.10, but after a year it costs N1.06 to buy goods we could have bought for N1 holding with N1.10 to spend next year, our purchasing power rises by only 4 percent.
The real interest rate is 4 percent.
Thus: Real interest rate = nominal interest rate –inflation rate To use this formula, by a second example: normal interest rates are 17% and inflation is 70%.
Leaving N100 for a year, you get N117, but it will cost you N120 to buy goods you could have bought today for N100.
You are worse off by 3% by delaying purchases for a year and lending your money at the apparently high rate of 17%.
Real interest rates are negative.
The real interest rate is 3%, in real terms it costs you to be a lender.
The nominal interest rate does not compensate for higher prices of goods you ultimately wish to buy.

Two forces lead to positive real interest rates.
First, people are impatient.
Given the choice of an equal number of goods tomorrow or today, we would rather have them today.
To delay spending on goods and services, savers have to be bribed with a positive real interest rate that lets them consume more goods in the future if they postpone consumption and lend today.
Second, there must be a way of earning positive real reforms or borrowers would never borrow.
Borrowers pay positive real interest rate because they can buy capital goods that provide a stream of return more than sufficient to meet the interest cost.
Importance to consumer and the productivity of physical capital are the two forces that lead us to expect a positive interest rate.
3.6 Nominal and Real GNP Nominal and real variables are also used in terms of GNP to measure economic performance.
Nominal GNP: measure GNP at the prices prevailing when income was earned.
Real GNP or GNP at constant price adjusts for inflation by measuring GNP in different years at the prices prevailing at some particular data known as the base year.
Consider table 3 which presents a simple hypothetical example of a white economy: Nominal GNP rises from N600 to N 1440 between 1980 as the base by valuing output quantities in 2002 using 1980 prices.
Real GNP rises only from N600 to N860.
This rise of 43% in real GNP gives a value by the economy as white.

The nominal data series is simply the data measured in current naira and gathered by a government or private survey.
The appropriate price index can come from any number of sources.
Among the more prominent price indexes are the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), the Personal Consumption Expenditure index (PCE) and the GDP deflator.
Common price indexes measure the value of a basket of goods in a certain time period, relative to the value of the same basket in a base period.
They are calculated by dividing the value of the basket of goods in the year of interest by the value in the base year.
By convention, this ratio is then multiplied by 100.
Generally speaking, statisticians set price indexes equal to 100 in a given base year for convenience and reference.
To use a price index to deflate a nominal series, the index must be divided by 100 (decimal form).
The formula for obtaining a real series is given by dividing nominal values by the price index (decimal form) for that same time period.
But how does this simple formula remove price fluctuations from actual changes in a variable’s overall value?
Economic variables measured in dollar values like GDP, exports, construction contract values, venture capital and retail sales are calculated from the product of the quantity sold and the selling price.
Analysts want to get their hands around the changes in quantity sold and disregard changes in prices because it is the quantity of goods and services consumed by households that affect well- 148 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS being, not the prices.
In effect, the percentage change in real values over a given time period should mirror the percentage change in quantity.
Table 1 provides three scenarios that show how to correct the data for price fluctuations.
In each scenario, price and quantity are multiplied together to arrive at a nominal value in 1990 and 1995.
Then the 1995 nominal value is divided by the ratio of the 1995 price index and the 1990 price index to arrive at a real value (or the 1995 value in 1990 dollars).
Deflating Nominal Nominal Real Scenario Period Price Quantity Value to Real Value 1.

Result: The nominal value increases 50 percent, but the real value remains the same.
Scenario 2: The price remains constant but quantity increases by 50 percent.
Result: The real value rises by 50 percent.
Scenario 3: The price rises 20 percent and quantity rises 25 percent.
Result: After deflating the 1995 value to 1990 dollars, the real value rises 25 percent.
3.8 Illustration and Notation on Real Values and Nominal Values 149  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS The simplest case of a bundle of commodities (goods) is one that has only one commodity.
In that case, output or consumption may be measured either in terms of money value (nominal) or physical quantity (real).
Let i designate that commodity and let: • P = the unit price of i, say, N5 i • Q = the quantity of i, say, 10 units.
i The nominal value of the bundle would then be price multiplied by quantity: • nominal value of i = P x Q =N5 x 10 = N50.
i i Given only the nominal value and price, derivation of a real value is immediate: • real value of bundle i = P x Q/P = Q = 50/5 = 10. i i i i The price “deflates” (divides) the nominal value to derive a real value, the quantity itself.
Similarly, for a series of years, say five, given only nominal values of the goods and prices in each year t, a real value can be derived for each of the five years: • real value of bundle i in year t = nominal value of Qt/Pt = Qt.
i i i This example generalises for nominal values relative to real values across different years for which P, a price index comparing the general price level across years, is available.
Consider a nominal value (say of an hourly wage rate) in each different year t. To derive a real-value series from a series of nominal values in different years, divide nominal value in each year by Pt, the price index in that year.
By definition then: • real value in year t = nominal value in year t/Pt.
Numerical Example If for years 1 and 2 (say 20 years apart) the nominal wage and P are N10 and N16 and 1.00 and 1.333, respectively.
The real wages are N10 (= 10/1.00) and N12 (= 16/1.333) respectively.
The real wage so constructed in each different year indexes the amount of commodities in that year that could be purchased relative to other years.
Thus, in the example, the price level increased by 33 percent, but the real wage rate still increased by 20 percent, permitting a 20 percent 150 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS increase in the quantity of commodities the nominal wage could purchase.
The generalisation to a commodity bundle from the single-good illustration above is to a bundle of quantities of different commodities and different years.
This has practical use, because price indexes and the National Income and Product Accounts are constructed from such bundles of commodities and their respective prices.
A sum of nominal values for each of the different commodities in the bundle is also called a nominal value.
A bundle of n different commodities with corresponding prices and quantities for each year t defines: • nominal value of that bundle in year t = P t x Q t + .
.
.
+ P t x Q t. 1 1 n n From the above: • P = the value of a price index in year t. t The nominal value of the bundle over a series of years and corresponding Pt define: • real value of the bundle in year t = Qt = nominal value of the bundle in year t/Pt.
Alternatively, multiplying both sides by Pt: • nominal value of the bundle in year t = Pt x Qt.
So, every nominal value can be dichotomised into a price-level part and a real part.
The real part Qt is an index of the quantities in the bundle.
An illustration of a nominal-value sum is nominal GDP.
An illustration of a real-value sum (or quotient) is real GDP.
3.9 Pitfall between Real and Nominal Value in Terms of Cash Flows Cash flows expected to occur in the future, expressed in real terms, are often equated with current values.
In the valuation of the cash flows we have two choices: cash flows are all denominated in real or in nominal terms.
In the first case, the cash flows are expressed in the currency of purchasing value as of the time of occurrence of the flow and in the second case they are expressed in 151  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS currency of purchasing value as of the day of the evaluation.
For example, a kilowatt/hour of electricity to be sold five years from now, in nominal terms would be valued at the actual price it is expected to cost five years from now, taking into account inflation and technological advancements.
In real terms, it should be valued at that price, deflated by the expected inflation in electricity prices over those years.
Unfortunately, to value it in real terms requires the forecast of the future price, including the rate of technological change, the competitive situation and the rate of inflation on electricity prices, not on the overall inflation level.
Most evaluations, to avoid these complex issues, value future cash flows at today's prices and call it a real value.
Nevertheless, today's price is neither a real nor nominal value.
Do you expect personal computers to cost the same five years from now?
If you were to express that future value in dollars of today's purchasing power, it would be far different than today's current value SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE 1.
Distinguish between nominal and real variables 2.
Distinguish between the concepts of nominal and real income, using a graphical approach.
4.0 CONCLUSION Real and nominal value denotes the difference between money valued with inflation adjustments, and valued as currency of the current time.
Due to inflation, the same amount of money at some time in the future may not have as much value, or purchasing power, as it does presently.
Essentially, although the face value may remain the same, that amount may not be as useful as it once had been.
5.0 SUMMARY We have learnt that real interest rates differ from nominal interest rates.
The expected real interest rate is equal to the nominal interest rate, minus the expected rate of inflation during the time of the investment.
Real value and nominal value are also used in other fields where an item has a stated measurement or amount, while it in fact is somewhat different.
For example, 56Kbps modems are only capable of transferring up to the speed of 53.3Kbps.
Voltage, such as in electric currents and batteries, also has variance (in some cases plus and/or minus).

The basic theory asserts that the prices of common goods between two countries should be equal once prices have been converted to a common currency.
Distilled to its basic form, purchasing power parity is a ratio that displays the relative price level differences across two countries for similar products or group of products.
154 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS PPP is used as a first step in making inter-country comparisons based in real terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and its component expenditures.
GDP is commonly used as an economic indicator for size, growth, and health of a nation.
PPP allows countries to be viewed through a common reference point.
Taken as a long-term theory, one should expect a convergence of all prices for common goods around the world in order for equilibrium to take affect and mitigate cost arbitrage opportunities.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • describe the basic concepts of PPP and how the theory of PPP works • identify the major uses of PPPs • calculate PPPs (the practical application of PPP and the flaws surrounding the application) • identify the problems associated with PPP.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 What is Purchasing Power Parity?
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a theory which states that exchange rates between currencies are in equilibrium when their purchasing power is the same in each of the two countries.
This means that the exchange rate between two countries should equal the ratio of the two countries' price level of a fixed basket of goods and services.
When a country's domestic price level is increasing (i.e., a country experiences inflation), that country's exchange rate must depreciate in order to return to PPP.
3.2 Building the Theory of Purchasing Power Parity To begin to understand PPP, one can start at how the theory is developed from the law of one price and then translated or generalised to the concepts of absolute purchasing power parity and relative purchasing power parity.
3.2.1 Law of One Price The foundation of purchasing power parity is grounded in the law of one price.
The theory states that barring frictional or complicating factors such as tariffs, taxes, and transportation costs, the price of an internationally traded good in one country should achieve the identical 155  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS price in another country, once the price is adjusted to a common currency.
To provide an illustrative context, a frequent example of purchasing power parity manifests itself in the form of the McDonald’s Big Mac TM.
Quite often, the economist will publish a light-hearted survey concerning the prices of a Big Mac TM from different countries in order to: (1) evaluate exchange rates based upon differences in the prices of this nearly ubiquitous good, (2) get a comparative sense of economic output and health across countries.
As an example, consider a basic ingredient to the Big Mac TM like a beef patty.
Assume that the price for a beef patty in the United States is represented asP $ and the price of the same beef patty in France is bp represented asP E, the law of one price can be expressed bp mathematically as follows: P $ = E*P E ………..(1) bp bp Here, E is the exchange rate between the euro/dollar.
Assume the cost of a pre-formed beef patty in the U.S. is $1.00 per patty.
If the euro/dollar exchange rate is 0.845316 (the spot rate as of 12/07/2005), then the price for the same beef patty in France should be €0.85.
An arbitrage opportunity could arise if the pre-formed patty sold for anything less than €0.85 in France.
A shrewd trader could then pu rchase pre-formed beef patties in France and resell them in the U.S. for a tidy profit until supply and demand forces took hold and drove down the prices in the U.S. market while driving up the prices in the French market.
This process would repeat itself until price convergence is achieved.
Thus, the law of one price holds true within this iterative pricing cycle for a discrete product like the beef patty.
3.2.2 Absolute PPP Using the intuition built by the law of one price for a discrete product, one can apply the principle across an aggregate of products and prices.
Or put in another way, one can imagine a common basket of goods that can be traded and prices compared across two countries- this is also known as the consumer price index (CPI).
By using price indices, one can rewrite equation (1) to make a relative comparison of overall price levels between France and the U.S., PEand P$: P E = E xP$ ..…….
( 2) E/$ 156 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Once againE , is the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar.
If E/$ PPP holds true, then equation (2) can be rearranged to derive the form of absolute PPP: PE 1 x =1 ………..(3.1) P$ EPPP E/$ Or PE = EPPP ………(3.2) P$ E/$ The left-hand side of equation 3.1 can also be referred to as the real exchange rate or the exchange rate that has been adjusted for relative pricing levels.
In the alternate form of equation 3.2, one can see that for purchasing power parity to hold, a very strict definition of the basket of goods must be met or the composition of the CPI must be identical.
However, in empirical usage, one finds international price indices are varied in goods and different weights assigned to those goods.
Another complication associated with international indices is that they must be constructed from similar base years.
The adaptation of the law of one price to PPP brings a particular nuance or wrinkle.
In the beef patty arbitrage example cited above, the trader would take advantage of the price differences between two markets and the exchange rate was assumed constant.
Here, there is an attempt to hold the price levels constant and it is the exchange rate that fluctuates.
This becomes the basis of the idea that PPP is a determinant of the exchange rates.
3.2.3 Relative PPP One sees from the discussion above, that in order to control a constant price differential between the two country’s indices, one can focus on measuring the relative purchasing power parity.
Using a relative PPP allows for a different basket of goods and varying weights to be applied towards the goods within the CPI.
This is because relative PPP states that fluctuations in the pricing levels will be related to the fluctuations in the exchange rates.
Changes in relative exchange rates are attributed to varying inflation rates across countries.
Thus, relative PPP can be expressed as follows: E2 - E1 E/$ E/$ =P - P ………( 4.1) E1 E $ E/$ 157  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Or %D E = %D PE - %D P$ ………..(4.2) E/$ In equation 4.1, one sees that the percent change in exchange rates over a given range of time will be equal to the differences in inflation of the euro, P , and the dollar,P E $ Put in a slightly different manner, equation 4.2 expresses the differences in percent changes in price levels in France and United states, also known as changes in relative inflation, as direct determinant in the relative changes in exchange rates between the two countries.
It is the calculation of relative PPP that many economists and theorist will anchor their empirical tests in order to prove out the validity of PPP.
3.3 PPP in the Long-Run Economists have conceived of an alternative way to interpret or apply the PPP theory to overcome the empirical testing problem.
The trick is to think of PPP as a “Long-Run” theory of exchange rate determination rather than a short-run theory.
Under such an interpretation, it is no longer necessary for PPP to hold at any point in time.
Instead, the PPP exchange rate is thought to represent a target towards which the spot exchange rate is slowly drawn.
This long-run interpretation requires an assumption that importers and exporters cannot respond quickly to deviations in the cost of market baskets between countries.
Instead of immediate responses to price differences between countries, by engaging in arbitrage, buying at the low price and selling high, traders respond slowly to these price signals.
Some reasons for the delay include imperfect information (traders are not aware of the price differences), long-term contracts (traders must wait till current contractual arrangements expire), and/or marketing costs (entry to new markets require research and setup costs).
In addition, we recognise that the exchange rate is not solely determined by trader behaviour.
Investors, who respond to different incentives, might cause persistent deviations from the PPP exchange rate even if traders continue to respond to the price differences.
When there is a delayed response, PPP no longer needs to hold at a particular point in time.
However, the theory does imagine that eventually, traders will adjust to the price differences, buying low and selling high, causing an eventual adjustment of the spot exchange rate towards the PPP rate.
However, as adjustment occurs, it is also quite 158 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS possible that the PPP exchange rate also continues to change.
In this case, the spot exchange rate is adjusting towards a moving target.
How long will this adjustment take?
In other words, how long is the long-run?
The term itself is generally used by economists to represent some “unspecified” long period of time.
It might be several months, several years or even several decades.
Also, since the target, the PPP exchange rate, is constantly changing, it is quite possible that it is never reached.
The adjustment process may never allow the exchange rate to catch up to the target, even though it is constantly chasing it.
Consider the chart below, the best way to see what the long-run PPP theory suggests is to consider the adjoining diagram.
The figure presents constructed data (i.e., made up) between two countries, A and B.
The solid black line shows the ratio of the costs of market baskets between the two countries over a long period of time, a century between 1904 and 2004.
It displays a steady increase, indicating that prices have risen faster in country A relative to country B.
The dotted blue line shows a plot of the exchange rate between the two countries during the same period.
If PPP were to hold at every point in time, then the exchange rate plot would lie directly on top of the market basket ratio plot.
The fact that it does not, means PPP did not hold all of the time.
In fact PPP held only at times when the exchange rate plot crosses the market basket ratio plot, on the diagram.
This happened only twice during the century - not a very good record.
3.4 Problems with the PPP Theory The main problem with the PPP theory is that the PPP condition is rarely satisfied within a country.
There are quite a few reasons that can 159  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS explain this and so, given the logic of the theory, which makes sense, economists have been reluctant to discard the theory on the basis of lack of supporting evidence.
Below, we consider some of the reasons PPP may not hold.
3.4.1 Transportation Costs The theory of the law of one price assumed that transportation costs were negligible and PPP requires the same assumption.
However, getting products to and from different markets can add significant costs to goods.
This will cause additional divergence in any price comparison when the product is applied to the basket of goods in a CPI.
There is research that estimates transportation costs add 7 percent to the price of U.S. imports of meat, 6 percent to the import of price of dairy products, and 16 percent to the import price of vegetables.
3.4.2 Tariffs and Taxes Once again, for PPP to hold, another key assumption underlying the law of one price is the abstraction of taxes and tariffs.
There can be no imposition of unequal taxes or tariffs in goods imported or exported across countries, otherwise this would tend to cause further separation of true price levels between markets.
A noted scholar on PPP, Cassel (1918), stated that “If trade between two countries is more hampered in one direction than in the other, the value of the money of the country whose export is relatively more restricted will fall, in the other country, beneath the purchasing power parity.” Export restrictions were particularly relevant during Cassel’s time due to their widespread use during the First World War.
The effect of export restrictions translates into the currency of a country with high export tariffs to be undervalued relative to PPP of another country with lower export tariffs.
Conversely, a country with higher import restrictions will be overvalued on PPP basis.
During the early nineties, Japan imposed quotas and tariffs on beef imports that went as high as 70 percent.
Likewise, Korea imposed a 30 percent tariff as well as quantity restrictions from 1989 through 1994.
Trade barriers such as these erected an obstruction to natural price equalisation of beef across the world markets, not to mention the impact upon the domestic prices of beef within Japan and Korea.
Imposed barriers to trade may be a partial explanation to the overvaluation of the yen and the war against the US dollar until the late 1990s.
Taxes also have the same effect as tariffs upon deviations away from PPP.
Many prices on goods that make up the composition of the consumer price index are inclusive of taxes or value added taxes.
For 160 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS instance, countries with higher rates of taxation (in comparison to the U.S.) on like goods such as beef patties will appear to have an overvalued currency relative to the U.S. dollar.
3.4.3 Costs of Non-Tradable Goods The theory of PPP asserts that after the barriers to trade are expunged, the cost of a good such as the Big Mac TM should be the same across all countries in which the Big Mac TM is traded.
However, the local price of a Big Mac TM constitutes more than simply the ingredients by which it is composed.
Also embedded in the local price is the cost associated with selling and marketing.
Even within the same country, the cost of the Big Mac TM can vary depending upon costs to lease or rent the restaurant space and pay for utilities such as power, water, and heat.
Rents and utilities are examples of non-tradable goods.
While it is possible for titles and deeds to be traded, the location of a property cannot.
Thus it may be cheaper to rent a space for a restaurant in Boise, Idaho than in Manhattan, NY, however, it is a useless comparison if one desires to sell Big Macs TM to the population in Manhattan.
Another component incorporated in the prices is the cost to serve, market, and sell the Big Mac TM, which may be significantly different from country to country.
Wages have always been understood to be a non-tradable good in economic terms.
There are inherent barriers to people’s ability to move across borders to take advantage of wage differences.
Costs of non-tradable goods can have a significant impact on pricing.
Ong, (1997), estimates that non-traded goods account for 94 percent of a Big Mac’s price.
3.4.4 Productivity A theory developed by Balassa and Samuelson (1964), states that the non-tradable goods have a systemic impact on the deviation from PPP due to its correlation with the productivity of a nation.
By incorporating non-tradable components into the goods that comprise the CPI, the inherent effect is to also incorporate the productivity differences across regions or countries.
An underlying assumption of the Balassa- Samuelson theory is that high per-capita wages are an indicator of higher productivity.
Thus, countries with high-wages will be overvalued relative to countries with lower-wages.
There are further supportive arguments that differences in productivity are most pronounced in the traded goods sector.
Therefore, high-productivity in traded goods will manifest in high-wages across all sectors - tradable goods and services - as companies within a country compete for workers.
Higher wages paid 161  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS for services in high-income countries relative to lower-income countries will cause higher prices for services in the high-income countries.
There is a “trickle-down” effect of high prices in tradable goods to services within a high-income country.
Thus, even if there were identical prices for tradable goods across countries, there would still be an overvaluation of currency in the high-income country.
3.4.5 Government Spending Another contributing factor for deviations from PPP is differences in government spending on non-tradable goods across different countries.
There is evidence that governments spend more on non-traded goods than the private sector does.
For instance, if the U.S. government increased expenditures relative to another government, the price of non- traded goods in the U.S. will increase along with the overall price levels, akin to the above.
Had PPP held prior to the expenditure, the dollar would now be overvalued relative to its PPP level.
This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in high income nations.
3.4.6 Current Account Deficits There is another related notion that purports a similar logic of the “trickle-down” price effects of non-tradable goods.
Krugman, a noted economist, theorises that governments who establish current account deficits are spending more on traded goods than other countries.
Hence, this will result in a drop in the price of non-traded goods in the deficit country.
Here, had PPP held previously, there will be a situation where the deficit country’s currency would be undervalued compared to its “healthier” neighbours.
3.4.7 Pricing to Market Another contributing factor to deviations from PPP is a firm’s ability to mark their products at different price points across different markets.
Basic business theory states that profit maximisation can be achieved by pricing as high as is appropriate considering the elasticity of demand for a product.
For instance, pharmaceutical companies often charge higher prices in the U.S. than in other countries for the same drug.
This is partially attributed to higher incomes found in the U.S. and the corresponding willingness-to-pay.
Another important factor that allows pricing to market is the ability to resell the product to another country.
There are heavy restrictions on selling drugs within the U.S. and there has been increased debate on whether people can purchase prescription drugs from countries such as Canada.
162 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.4.8 Perfect Information The law of one price assumes that individuals have good, even perfect, information about the prices of goods in other markets.
Only with this knowledge will profit-seekers begin to export goods to the high price market and import goods from the low priced market.
Consider a case in which there is imperfect information.
Perhaps some price deviations are known to traders but other deviations are not known.
Or maybe only a small group of traders know about a price discrepancy and that group is unable to achieve the scale of trade needed to equalise the prices for that product.
(Perhaps they face capital constraints and cannot borrow enough money to finance the scale of trade needed to equalise prices).
In either case, traders without information about price differences will not respond to the profit opportunities and thus prices will not be equalised.
Thus, the law of one price may not hold for some products which would imply that PPP would not hold either.

It is based on the law of one price: the theory states that, in ideally efficient markets, identical goods should have only one price.
The PPP relationship becomes a theory of exchange rate determination by introducing assumptions about the behaviour of importers and exporters in response to changes in the relative costs of national market baskets.
Recall the story of the law of one price, when the price of a good differed between two countries’ markets, there was an incentive for profit-seeking individuals to buy the good in the low price market and resell it in the high price market.
Similarly, if a market basket, containing many different goods and services, costs more in one market than another, we should likewise expect profit-seeking individuals to buy the relatively cheaper goods in the low cost market and resell them in the higher priced market.
If the law of one price leads to the equalisation of the prices of goods between two markets, then it seems reasonable to conclude that PPP, describing the equality of market baskets across countries, should also hold.
However, adjustment within the PPP theory occurs with a twist compared to adjustment in the law of one price story.
In the law of one price story, goods arbitrage in a particular product was expected to affect the prices of the goods in the two markets.
The twist included in the PPP theory is that arbitrage, occurring across a range of goods and 165  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS services in the market basket, will affect the exchange rate rather than the market prices.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • discuss the PPP theory and real exchange rate • calculate based on PPP • explain equilibrium story in an economic model.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The PPP Equilibrium Story To see why the PPP relationship represents equilibrium, we need to tell an equilibrium story.
An equilibrium story in an economic model is an explanation of how the behaviour of individuals will cause the equilibrium condition to be satisfied.
The equilibrium condition is the PPP equation developed below, CB EPPP = P ……(1) P/$ CB $ The endogenous variable in the PPP theory is the exchange rate.
Thus, we need to explain why the exchange rate will change if it is not in equilibrium.
In general, there are always two versions of an equilibrium story, one in which the endogenous variable (E here) is too high, and p/$ one in which it is too low.
PPP Equilibrium Story 1 Let's consider the case in which the exchange rate is too low to be in equilibrium.
This means that, 166 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS CB E < P ⇒CB E <CB ..………(2) P/$ CB $ P/$ P $ where E is the exchange rate that prevails on the spot market and, p/$ since it is less than the ratio of the market basket costs in Mexico and the US, it is also less than the PPP exchange rate.
The right-hand side of the expression is rewritten to show that the cost of a market basket in the US evaluated in pesos, CB E , is less than the cost of the market basket in $ p/$ Mexico also evaluated in pesos.
Thus, it is cheaper to buy the basket in the US, or, more profitable to sell items in the market basket in Mexico.
The PPP theory now suggests that the cheaper basket in the US will lead to an increase in demand for goods in the US market basket by Mexico, and, as a consequence, will increase the demand for US dollars on the foreign exchange market.
Dollars are needed because purchases of US goods require US dollars.
Alternatively, US exporters will realise that goods sold in the US can be sold at a higher price in Mexico.
If these goods are sold in pesos, the US exporters will want to convert the proceeds back to dollars.
Thus, there is an increase in US dollar demand (by Mexican importers) and an increase in peso supply (by US exporters) on the Forex.
This effect is represented by a rightward shift in the US dollar demand curve in the adjoining diagram.
At the same time, US consumers will reduce their demand for the pricier Mexican goods.
This will reduce the supply of dollars (in exchange for pesos) on the Forex which is represented by a leftward shift in the US dollar supply curve in the Forex market.
167  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Both the shift in demand and supply will cause an increase in the value of the dollar and thus the exchange rate, E , will rise.
As long as the US p/$ market basket remains cheaper, excess demand for the dollar will persist and the exchange rate will continue to rise.
The pressure for change ceases once the exchange rate rises enough to equalise the cost of market baskets between the two countries and PPP holds.
PPP Equilibrium Story 2 Now let us consider the other equilibrium story, that is, the case in which the exchange rate is too high to be in equilibrium.
This implies that, CB E > P ⇒CB E >CB ..….. (3) P/$ CB $ P/$ P $ The left-hand side expression says that the spot exchange rate is greater than the ratio of the costs of market baskets between Mexico and the US.
In other words the exchange rate is above the PPP exchange rate.
The right-hand side expression says that the cost of a US market basket, converted to pesos at the current exchange rate, is greater than the cost of a Mexican market basket in pesos.
Thus, on average US goods are relatively more expensive while Mexican goods are relatively cheaper.
The price discrepancies should lead consumers in the US, or importing firms, to purchase less expensive goods in Mexico.
To do so, they will raise the supply of dollars in the Forex in exchange for pesos.
Thus, the supply curve of dollars will shift to the right as shown in the adjoining diagram.
At the same time, Mexican consumers would refrain from purchasing the more expensive US goods.
This would lead to a reduction in demand for dollars in exchange for pesos on the Forex.
168 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Hence the demand curve for dollars shifts to the left.
Due to the demand decrease and the supply increase, the exchange rate, E , falls.
This p/$ means that the dollar depreciates and the peso appreciates.
Extra demand for pesos will continue as long as goods and services remain cheaper in Mexico.
However, as the peso appreciates (the $ depreciates) the cost of Mexican goods rises relative to US goods.
The process ceases once the PPP exchange rate is reached and market baskets cost the same in both markets.
3.2 Adjustment to Price Level Changes under PPP In the PPP theory, exchange rate changes are induced by changes in relative price levels between two countries.
This is true because the quantities of the goods are always presumed to remain fixed in the market baskets.
Therefore, the only way that the cost of the basket can change is if the goods' prices change.
Since price level changes represent inflation rates, this means that differential inflation rates will induce exchange rate changes according to the theory.
If we imagine that a country begins with PPP, then the inequality given in equilibrium story 1,CB E <CB , can arise if the price level rises in $ P/$ P Mexico (peso inflation), if the price level falls in the US ($ deflation), or if Mexican inflation is more rapid than US inflation.
According to the theory, the behaviour of importers and exporters would now induce a dollar appreciation and peso depreciation.
In summary, an increase in Mexican prices relative to the change in US prices (i.e., more rapid inflation in Mexico than in the US) will cause the dollar to appreciate and the peso to depreciate according to the purchasing power parity theory.
Similarly, if a country begins with PPP, then the inequality given in equilibrium story 2, CB E >CB , can arise if the price level rises in $ P/$ P the US ($ inflation), the price level falls in Mexico (peso deflation) or if US inflation is more rapid than Mexican inflation.
In this case, the inequality would affect the behaviour of importers and exporters and induce a dollar depreciation and peso appreciation.
In summary, more rapid inflation in the US would cause the dollar to depreciate while the peso would appreciate.
169  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.3 Purchasing Power Parity Theory and Real Exchange Rate The absolute purchasing power parity theory suggests that, in the long run, P = P*/W, ………..(4) whereby P denotes the price of a given basket of goods in the domestic country and P* denotes the corresponding price abroad; W is the nominal exchange rate between the domestic country and the foreign country, expressed as the price of the domestic currency in units of the foreign currency, as is usually the case for euro exchange rates for example.
A nominal appreciation of the domestic currency is therefore reflected by a rise in W. The relative purchasing power parity theory, however, is characterised by the long-run validity of P = c(P*/W) ……..(5) Whereby c represents a constant.
If growth rates are flagged with a “^”, (5) results in ^ ^* W = P - P ………(6) According to (5), the purchasing power ratio between the domestic country and the foreign country is constant if the relative purchasing power parity theory holds.
According to (6), the rate of change in the nominal exchange rate is equal to the inflation differential.
If the countries in question are members of a monetary union, the nominal exchange rate is permanently fixed at W = 1.
In such cases, the absolute purchasing power parity theory implies that domestic and foreign price levels should be identical in the long run, P = P* according to (4), and the relative purchasing power parity theory suggests that the inflation differentials according to (6) cancel out in the long run, ^ P* = ^ P. In the majority of cases, the real exchange rate R is used as an indicator of an economy’s price competitiveness.
This may be defined as R =W (P/P*) ………(7) Equation (7) shows that the concept of a real exchange rate may also be applied to countries within a monetary union, where it is defined as the price ratio between the domestic country and the foreign country (R = P/P*).
Equations (4), (5) and (7) show that absolute purchasing power parity is achieved if the real exchange rate is R =1 or In(R) = 0 and that relative purchasing power parity is achieved if R = c or In(R) = In(c).
170 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Since the purchasing power parity theory is a long-run concept, it only applies if In (R) is stationary (relative version) or if In (R) is stationary at 0 (absolute version).
The indicator of the price competitiveness of the German economy is essentially no more than a trade weighted real exchange rate whereby the weights of individual trading partners correspond to their significance in German foreign trade.
3.4 Purchasing Power Parity Theory as a Theoretical Concept There are two versions of purchasing power parity theory – an absolute and a relative one.
Absolute purchasing power parity theory states that a basket of goods costs the same domestically and abroad if the goods prices are converted into a common currency.
In other words, absolute purchasing power parity theory postulates that the purchasing power of money is equal between countries.
By contrast, relative purchasing power parity theory does not compare domestic and foreign levels of purchasing power, but rather focuses on changes in this purchasing power.
Relative purchasing power parity theory therefore states that the inflation rate differentials between two countries or regions are offset through inverse changes in the nominal exchange rate so that the purchasing power ratio between the two remains constant.
It therefore follows that the validity of absolute purchasing power parity theory implies the validity of relative purchasing power parity theory, but not vice versa.
3.5 Calculation Based on PPP The simplest way to calculate purchasing power parity between two countries is to compare the price of a "standard" good that is in fact identical across countries.
Every year The Economist magazine publishes a light-hearted version of PPP: in its "Hamburger Index" that compares the price of a McDonald's hamburger around the world.
More sophisticated versions of PPP look at a large number of goods and services.
One of the key problems is that people in different countries consume very different sets of goods and services, making it difficult to compare the purchasing power between countries.
171  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Consider the following information about movie video tapes sold in the US and Mexican markets.
Price of videos in US market (P v) $20 $ Price of videos in Mexican market (P v) p150 p Spot exchange rate (E ) 10p/$ p/$ The dollar price of videos sold in Mexico can be calculated by dividing the video price in pesos by the spot exchange rate as shown, To see why the peso price is divided by the exchange rate (rather than multiplied), notice the conversion of units shown in the brackets.
If the law of one price held, then the dollar price in Mexico should match the price in the US.
Since the dollar price of the video is less than the dollar price in the US, the law of one price does not hold in this circumstance.
The next question to ask is what might happen as a result of the discrepancy in prices.
Well, as long as there are no costs incurred to transport the goods, there is a profit-making opportunity through trade.
For example, US travelers in Mexico who recognise that identical video titles are selling there for 25% less might buy videos in Mexico and bring them back to the US to sell.
This is an example of “goods arbitrage.” An arbitrage opportunity arises whenever one can buy something at a low price in one location and resell at a higher price and thus make a profit.
Using basic supply and demand theory, the increase in demand for videos in Mexico would push the price of videos up.
The increase supply of videos in the US market would force the price down in the US.
In the end, the price of videos in Mexico may rise to, say, 180 pesos while the price of videos in the US may fall to $18.
At these new prices the law of one price holds since, 172 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS The idea between the laws of one price is that identical goods selling in an integrated market, where there are no transportation costs or differential taxes or subsidies, should sell at identical prices.
If different prices prevailed then there would be profit-making opportunities by buying the goods in the low price market and reselling it in the high price market.
If entrepreneurs acted in this way, then the prices would converge to equality.
Of course, for many reasons the law of one price does not hold even between markets within a country.
The prices of beer, gasoline and stereos will likely be different in New York City than in Los Angeles.
The prices of these items will also be different in other countries when converted at current exchange rates.
The simple reason for the discrepancies is that there are costs to transport goods between locations, there are different taxes applied in different states and different countries, non-tradable input prices may vary, and people do not have perfect information about the prices of goods in all markets at all times.
Thus, to refer to this as an economic "law" does seem to exaggerate its validity.

4.0 CONCLUSION PPP between two countries is the comparison of the price of a standard good that is identical across countries.
It lumps items together into broad class, not putting quantity into consideration.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have learnt that: • purchasing power parity is of course an imperfect device for determining things such as GDP, as the exchange rate will vary based on the basket item used for the index.
• the problem can be minimised by considering large sample commodities rather than one or two.

The index combines measures of expectancy, school enrolment, literacy, and income to provide a broader-based measure of well-being and development than income alone.
Since its publication, this index has become widely cited and is commonly used as a way of ranking the quality of life in different countries.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of the unit, you should be able to: • describe human development and human development index • compute human development index and physical quality of life index • distinguish the relationship between economic growth and human development.
175  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Meaning of Human Development The UNDP incorporated Sen's view in its first Human Development Report in 1990.
According to it, human development goes far beyond income and growth to cover all human capabilities—the needs, aspirations and choice of the people.
It defined human development as “a process of enlarging people's choices” that is created by expanding human capabilities.
Income is one of the choices but it is not the only choice.
Rise in income is not the same thing as the increase in human capabilities.
Besides higher income, poor people put a high value on adequate nutrition, access to safe drinking water, better medical facilities, better school for their children, affordable transport, adequate shelter, secure livelihood and productive and satisfying jobs.
Human development is a broad and comprehensive concept.
It is as much concerned with economic growth as with its distribution, as with basic human needs as with variety of human aspirations, as with the distress of the rich countries, and as with the human deprivation of the poor.
The Report also explained the relationship between economic growth and human development.
It emphasised, that there is no automatic link between the two.
Economic growth is important because no society has been able to sustain the well-being of its people without continuous growth; so economic growth is essential for human development.
However, human development is equally important because it is healthy and educates people who contribute more to economic growth through productive employment and increase in income.
Thus, human development and economic growth are closely connected.
In reality, economic growth is a means to an end, and the end is human development.
Policy makers should, therefore, pay more attention to the quality of growth so as to support all-round human development.
3.2 Human Development Indices Economists have tried to measure social indicators of basic needs by taking one, two or more indicators for constructing composite indices of human development.
We study below the Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) of Morris and the Human Development Index (HDI) as developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
3.2.1 Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) The Physical Quality of Life Index was the most serious challenge to GNP per capita as the index of development.
It was invented by M.D.
Morris in 1979.
He constructed a composite Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI) 176 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS relating to 23 developing countries for a comparative study.
He combines three component indicators of infant mortality, life expectancy at age one and basic literacy at age 15 to measure performance in meeting the most basic needs of the people.
This index represents a wide range of indicators such as health, education, drinking water, nutrition and sanitation.
The PQLI shows improvement in the quality of life when people enjoy the fruits of economic progress with increase in life expectancy (LE), fall in infant mortality rate (IMR) and rise in basic literacy rate (BLR).
Each indicator of the three components is placed on a scale of zero to 100 where zero represents an absolutely defined worst performance and 100 represents an absolutely defined best performance.
The PQLI index is calculated by averaging the three indicators giving equal weight to each and the index is also scaled from 0 to 100.
If the indicators of life expectancy and basic literacy rate are positive, the best performance is shown as the maximum and the worst as the minimum.
Infant mortality rate, being a negative indicator, for this the best indicator is shown as the minimum and the worst as the maximum.
To find out the achievement level of the positive variable, its minimum value is deducted from its actual value and the balance is divided by the difference (range) between maximum value and minimum value i.e.
ActualValue- Minimun Value Achievement Level= Max.Value- Min.Value To find out the achievement level for a negative indicator, its actual value is deducted from its maximum value and the balance is divided by the difference (range; between maximum value and minimum value i.e.
Max.
Value- Actual Value Achievement Level= Max.Value- Min.Value For life expectancy and Infant mortality rate, there is no natural maximum and minimum value.
However, there is the need to select the right values.
According to Morris, each of the three indicators measures results and not inputs such as income.
Each is sensitive to distribution effects.
It means that an improvement in these indicators signifies an increase in the proportion of people benefiting from them.
But none of the indicators depends on any particular level of development.
Each indicator lends itself to international comparison.
Taking Gabon's infants’ mortality rate of 229 per thousand live births as the worst rate in 1950, Morris sets it at 0.
At the 177  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS upper end, the best achievement is set at 9 per thousand for the year 2000.
Again, taking Vietnam's life expectancy at age one as 38 years in 1950, Morris sets it at 0 of the life expectancy index.
The upper limit is set at 77 years for men and women combined for the year 2000.
Lastly, the basic literacy rate at 15 years is taken as the literacy index.
This set of values is presented in Table 1.
Table 1: Maximum and minimum values of component indicators Dimension Maximum Minimum Range Infant mortality rate 229 9 220 Life expectancy at age one 77 38 39 Basic literacy rate 180 0 100 On this basis, Morris presents the following correlation of (N=150).
(N = 150) Infant Mortality Life Expectancy Life expectancy A age one -0.1-919 -+ Literacy -0.919 0.897 The coefficient of correlation between life expectancy at age one and infant mortality is of a high degree and negative.
Similarly, the correlation between literacy and infant mortality rate i.e., with literacy, infant mortality rate declines.
The coefficient between literacy and life expectancy shows a high degree of-positive correlation i.e., with literacy, the life expectancy also increases.
Morris regards life expectancy at age one and infant mortality as very good indicators of the physical quality of life.
So are literacy and life expectancy.
In fact, the literacy indicator reflects the potential for development.
We present in Table 2 the PQLI performance and GNP per capita of two LDCs and two developed countries.
Table 2: PQLI Performance and GNP per Capita Growth Rate PQLI Average annual GNP Country 1950 1960 1970 Per capita growth Rate India 14 30 40 1.8 Sri Lanka 65 75 80 1.9 Italy 80 87 92 5.0 USA 89 91 93 2.4 Source: Morris D. Morris and M.B.
McAlpin, Measuring the Conditions of India's Poor, 1982.
178 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS The above table reveals that India, which Morris calls a "basket case", exhibited slow but not insignificant improvement in its PQLI from 14 to 40 over a period of two decades from, 1950 to 1970, despite its low growth in average GNP per capita of 1.8.
On the other hand, Sri Lanka's PQLI was much higher than India's during this period, though its average GNP per capita was almost the same.
Of the two developed countries, both Italy and USA had very high PQLI.
But Italy's average GNP per capita was more than double the USA.
In this connection, Morris observes that there is no automatic link between GNP per capita and PQLI.
In fact, the presence or absence of social relations, nutritional status, public health, education and family environment determine a society's PQLI.
Further, it takes considerable time to build institutional arrangements that can generate and sustain a high PQLI.
Its Limitations • The PQLI tries to measure “quality of life” directly rather than indirectly.
However, it has its limitations.
• Morris admits that PQLI is a limited measure of basic needs.
It supplements but does not supplant the GNP.
It fails to dislodge GNP from its lofty perch.
It does not explain the changing structure of economic and social organisation.
It, therefore, does not measure economic development.
Similarly it does not measure total welfare.
• Morris has been criticised for using equal weights for the three variables of his PQLI which undermine the value of the index in a comparative analysis of different countries.
• According to Meier, “Non-income factors captured by the PQLI are important, but so are income and consumption statistics and distribution-sensitive methods of aggregation that are ignored by it.
Conclusion Despite these limitations, the PQLI can be used to identify particular regions of underdevelopment and groups of society suffering from the neglect or failure of social policy.
It points towards that indicator where immediate action is required.
The state can take up such policies which increase the PQLI rapidly along with economic growth.
3.2.2 Construction of PQLI On the basis of the values of the component indicators given in Table 1, we can construct the PQLI in the following manner.
179  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 229- ActualIMR IMRI = 220 ActualLIfeExpectancy- 38 LEI = 39 ActualLIfeacyLervel - 0 BEI = 100 We calculate the PQLI for India on the basis of 2001 Census data for these variables: IMR = 67, LE = 65 years, and BL = 65%.
229- 69 IMRI = = 0.74 220 65- 38 LEI = =0.69 39 65- 0 BEI = =0.65 100 IMRI + LEI + BLI 0.74+0.69+0.65 PQLI = = 3 3 2.08 = = 0.69 3 Thus the Physical Quality of Life Index for India in 2001 was 0.69.
3.3 Human Development Index (HDI) Lord Meghnad Desai and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen invented the Human Development Index and UNDP incorporated it into its first Human Development Report in 1990.
Since then, the UNDP has been presenting the measurement of human development in terms of HDI in its annual report.
The HDI is a composite index of three social indicators: life expectancy, adult literacy and years of schooling.
It also takes into account real GDP per capita.
Thus, the HDI is a composite index of three fundamental dimensions: living a long and healthy life, being educated and having decent standard of living.
The HDI value of a country is calculated by using the following three indicators.
Longevity, as measured by life expectancy at birth.
Educational attainment, as measured by a combination of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and combined primary, secondary and tertiary enrolment ratio (one- third weight).
Decent Standard of living, as measured by real GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity in terms of dollar (PPP$).
Before the HDI is calculated, an index is created for each of these dimensions: Life Expectancy Index, Education Index and GDP Index.
To 180 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS calculate these indices, minimum and maximum values or goal posts are chosen for each indicator.
Table 3: Goalposts for Calculating the HDI Indicator Max, Value Mim value Life expectancy at birth (yes) 85 25 Adult literacy rate (%) 100 0 Combined gross enrolment ratio (%) 100 0 GDP per capita (PPP US$) 40,000 100 Performance in each dimension is expressed as a value between 0 and 1 by applying the following formula: ActualValue- Min.Value DimensionIndex = Max.Value- Min.value The HDI is then calculated as a simple average of the three dimension indices.
The HDI value for each country indicates the distance it has travelled towards the maximum possible value of 1 and how far it has to go to attain certain defined goals: an average life span of 85 years, access to education for all and a decent standard of living.
The DHI ranks countries in relation to each other.
A country's HDI rank is within the world distribution i.e., it is based on its HDI value in relation to each developed and developing country for which the particular country has travelled from the minimum HDI value of 0 towards the maximum HDI value of 1.
Countries with an HDI value below 0.5 are considered to have a low level of human development, those from 0.5 to 0.8 a medium level and those above 0.8 a high level.
In the HDI, countries are also ranked by their GDP per capita.
The Human Development Report, 2004 presented the HDI values, HDI rank, and real GDP per capita ranks for the year 2002 relating to 177 developed and developing countries.
Table 4 shows HDI values and HDI and HDI ranks for some of the countries.
181  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Table 4: Human Development Index for Selected Countries, 2002 Country HDI Value HDI Rank GDP per capita Rank minus HDI Rank 1.
High Human Development Norway 0.956 1 1 Australia 0.946 3 9 USA 0.939 8 4 Japan 0.938 9 6 United kingdom 0.936 12 8 France 0.932 16 0 Costa Rica 0.834 45 14 2.
Medium Human Development Russian Federation 0.795 57 3 Malaysia 0.793 59 2 Mauritius 0.785 64 15 China 0.745 94 5 Sri Lanka 0.740 96 16 India 0.595 127 10 Bhutan 0.536 134 0 Nepal 0.504 140 11 3.
Low Human Development Pakistan 0.497 142 7 Uganda 0.493 146 4 Zimbabwe 0.491 147 25 Kenya 0.488 148 1 Nigeria 0.466 151 15 Tanzania 0.407 162 12 Zambia 0.389 164 3 Source: Human Development Report, 2004.
Of the 177 countries for which the HDI was calculated, 55 were in the high development category (with an HDI value of 0.80 or more) 86 medium category (0.5 to 0.79); and 36 in the low category (less than 0.50) Norway, Australia and USA led the HDI rankings in the high HD category.
In the medium category, Bulgaria led with HDI rank of 56, Sri Lanka 96, India, 127, Bhutan 134, Bangladesh 138, and Nepal 140.
In the Low category, Pakistan led with 142, Uganda 146, Zimbabwe 147, Nigeria 151, Tanzania 162 and Zambia 164.
Thus the DHI reveals wide disparities in global human development.
For instance, Norway's HDI value of 0.956 was more than three times of Sierra Leone’s of 0.273 which was at the bottom.
182 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS The HDI reveals that countries can have similar GDP per capita levels but different HDI values or similar HDI values but very different GDP per capita levels.
Thus the HDI ranking of countries differ significantly from their ranking by GDP per capita.
Countries whose GDP rank is higher than their HDI rank have considerable potential for distributing the benefits of higher incomes more equitably.
But they have been less successful in channeling economic prosperity into better lives from their people.
Of the 177 countries in 2002, there were 71 such countries whose HDI rank was lower than their GDP per capita rank.
Prominent among them were Algeria (-103), India (-10), USA (-4), Pakistan (-7) and Zimbabwe (-25).
On the other hand, countries whose HDI rank is higher than their GDP rank, suggest that they have effectively made use of their incomes to improve the lives of their people.
There were 106 such countries in 2002.
Prominent among them were Cuba (39) and Tajikistan (45).
It is said that the DHI led to the dethronement of GDP per capita.
As a matter of fact, these two concepts do not measure the same thing.
The HDI tries to measure the level of human capabilities and the set of choices available to people.
On the other hand, GNP per capita is an indicator of well being, utility or welfare, the subjective enjoyment people get from consumption.
Thus the HDI is an alternative measure of development.
It supplements rather than supplants GNP per capita measure of development and provides different information from GNP per capita.
Its Limitations • The HDI is not free from certain limitations.
• It is a crude index which attempts to catch in one simple number a complex reality about human development and deprivation, according to Prof. Amartya Sen. • The three indicators are not the only indicators of human development.
There can be others like infant mortality, nutrition, etc.
• The HDI measures relative rather than absolute human development so that if all countries improve their HDI value at the same weighted rate, the low human countries will not get recognition for their improvement.
• The weighting scheme for calculating the four components of HDI seems arbitrary.
• Even, giving equal (l/3rd) weight to each of the very different three indices for calculating the HDI, it is still arbitrary to the extent that one component index has a different variance than another, and equal weights seem unsatisfactory and unjustified.
A country having high HDI may shift the focus from the high inequality, unemployment and poverty found within it.
183  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Conclusion Despite these weaknesses, by measuring average achievements in health, education and income, the HDI provides a better picture of the state of a country's development than its income alone.
3.3.1 Constructing the Human Development Index (HDI) The HDI is based on three indicators: longevity, as measured by life expectancy at birth; educational attainment, as measured by a combination of adult literacy (two-thirds weight) and combined primary, secondary and tertiary enrolment ratios (one-third weight); and standard of living, as measured by real per capita(PPP$): For the construction of the index, fixed minimum and maximum values have been set for each of these indicators: • Life expectancy at birth: 25 years and 85 years for calculating the Life expectancy Index.
• Adult literacy: 0% and 100% for calculating the Education Index.
Combined gross enrolment ratio (0% and 100%) • Real GDP per capita (PPP$): $100 and $40,000 (PPP US$) for calculating GDP Index.
For any component of the HDI, individual indices can be computed by applying the formula: ActualValue- Min.Value DimensionIndex= Max.Value- Min.value 1.
Life Expectancy Index.
If the life expectancy at birth of a country is 78 years, then the life expectancy index for that country would be 78- 25 53 LifeExpectancyIndex = = = 0.884 85- 25 60 2.
Education Index.
The education Index is the combination of adult literacy index and gross enrolment index.
If the adult literacy rate of this country is 92, then its adult literacy index would be 92- 0 AdultLiteracy Index= =0.920 100- 0 184 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS If the combined gross enrolment in this country is 60, then its gross enrolment index would be 60- 0 GrossEnrolmentIndex = = 0.600 100- 0 Education Index = 2/3 (Adult Literacy Index) + 1/3 (Gross Enrolment Index) = 2/3 (0.920) + 1/3 (0.600) = 0.813 3.
GDP Index.
The GDP per capita (PPPUS$) of this country is $8,840, then the GDP index would be log(8,840)- log(100) log8740 GDPIndex = = = 0.748 log(40,000)- log(100) log(100) 4.
Human Development Index.
The HDI is a simple average of the Life Expectancy Index, Education Index and adjusted GDP per capita (PPP$) Index.
It is derived by dividing the sum of these three indices by 3.
0.884+0.813+0.784 HDI = =0.815.

What is human development index?
2.
What are the three component indicators for measuring quality life index?
4.0 CONCLUSION Human development is a broad and comprehensive concept which is concerned with basic human capabilities i.e.
basic human needs as with variety of human aspirations.
5.0 SUMMARY We have been able to see that HDI is a composite index which combines measures of expectancy, school enrolment, literacy and income to provide a broader based measure of basic needs, their economic growth and development.
Remember that the composite HDI indices used to measure human capabilities are PQLI and HDI as developed by the UNDP , where PQLI shows improvement in the quality of life when people enjoy the fruits of 185  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS economic progress with increase in life expectancy.
HDI is a composite index which takes into accounts real GDP per capital.

These tools often enable economists to widen the frontiers of their analytical concerns to issues that have significant economic implications, even though they may not be strictly economic in nature.
Corruption is an example of such an issue.
The magnitude of corruption has varied among different societies and in different historical epochs.
In contemporary times, this issue has assumed such a significant dimension as a social problem in some LCDs that discussion of it can not be ignored.
2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • explain the meaning of corruption at all levels • identify and determine corruption • appreciate the effects and demands of corruption • proffer solutions to the problems of corruption.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 What Is Corruption?
Corruption is a word used to cover a wide range of morally offensive or criminal acts; thus, its precise definition is not easy.
Gray and Kaufman define corruption as the abuse of public office for private gain.
Thus, it refers to the use of position of power to seek personal advantage either by performing an act or omission of the expected performance/duty.
A typical dictionary definition refers to corruption as various offences by public officials including bribery, the sale of offices, gaining of public contracts to favoured firms and individuals and granting of land or franchise in return for monetary rewards.
There is no comprehensive and universally accepted definition of corruption.
The origin of the word is from the Latin corruptus (spoiled) and corrumpere (to ruin; to break into pieces).
The working definitions presently in vogue are variations of "the misuse of a public or private position for direct or indirect personal gain".
This definition does point to some critical factors that come to mind when the word corruption is mentioned.
Nevertheless, it is still limited.
For example, the reward of the public official may be non-monetary, but this would not make the act less corrupt.
A public official may deliberately connive at a violation of another person's rights by 188 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS remaining silent.
This again is corruption.
Indeed, without defining it exactly, most people recognise corruption when they see it.
3.2 Manifestation of Corruption Corruption is a worldwide phenomenon which exists in all countries.
In the United States, for instance, corrupt economic practices is referred to as ‘underground economy’ and in 1982, it was estimated to have accounted for about 14% of the GDP.
More recently, corrupt practices bordering on crime have been uncovered in large corporations like Enron, World Com and Tyco.
In the former Soviet empire, corruption was referred to as na leva, meaning ‘on the left’ (OLE) economy.
It has been shown that during the Communist era, OLE was capable of supplying the Soviet people with their basic needs outside of the official system.
The transitional period to a liberalised economic system witnessed many corrupt activities especially during the process of privatisation.
‘Smart’ businessmen engaged in ‘sharp’ practices and this led to the emergence of a minority of very rich individuals — referred to as ‘Mafia’ capitalists.
In Italy, the underground economy is known to employ young people off the official record so as to escape giving them officially mandated benefits.
In recent times, Transparency International, a Berlin-based international non-governmental organisation (NGO), has been measuring corruption index.
The Transparency International Corruption Index (TICI) is a measure of perception of corruption as seen by business people, risk analysts and the general public.
TICI ranges from one to ten, with the index of ten reflecting 'highly corrupt'.
Countries over the world have been rated in terms of their intensity of corruption.
In 2003, Nigeria was rated the second most corrupt country, second only to Bangladesh while Finland was the most incorrupt, followed by Singapore, Britain, Hongkong, Germany and United States.
Between 1998 and 2001, TICI, focusing on African countries showed that corruption tended to be less in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa while it was consistently high in Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya and Cameroon.
Given the pervasiveness of corruption especially in African countries, the big question is: why are people corrupt?
We shall address this question theoretically by considering an economic model of corruption next.
3.2.1 An Economic Model of Corruption Corruption can be analysed within the neo-classical utility maximising framework.
In this context, an economic agent is assumed to be 189  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS maximising some net utility from engaging in corrupt activities.
She/He, therefore, has a positive demand for corruption.
The individual's demand for corruption (DiC) is determined by several factors.
These factors include net gains from corruption (G), costs of undertaking corruption (C), expected punishment and probability of its occurrence (Pe), economic incentives for corruption (V), the level of income (Y1), distribution of income (Yd) and the level of individual education (E).
Symbolically, therefore, the demand equation for corruption can be written as: • DiC = f [G, C, Pe, V, Y1, Yd, E] Each of these determinants affects the demand for corruption, especially in the African context.
3.2.2 Net Gains from Corruption Net gains from corruption are the difference between the benefits and direct costs of corruption.
If the net gain is positive, corruption will take place.
It then follows that the higher the net gain from corruption, the higher the degree of corruption in any given society.
Under this circumstance, the demand for corruption behaves like a normal good.
Demand for corruption is, therefore, a direct function of net gains.
Dc starts from the origin, thereby implying that, if net gains from corruption are zero, there would be no corruption.
As net gains from corruption increase, more of it will be demanded by individuals in a given society, ceteris paribus.
It must be noted that the gains from corruption may be monetary, non-monetary or psychological.
Thus, some of the gains can be quantified but a good number of them cannot.
Dc Net gain (benefits-costs) 190 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.2.3 Costs of Engaging in Corrupt Activities Like any other economic enterprise, corruption requires resources (inputs).
These inputs constitute the cost of corruption and comprises direct and indirect (opportunity) costs.
Consider the following examples The chairman of the tender’s board, who is given the responsibility of awarding major contracts, wants to amass personal wealth by corrupt means.
He will have to incur the costs of using his time and resources to lobby other members of the board and the contractors to get them to agree to his proposals.
These are direct costs.
The opportunity costs are the options which are given up to pursue corrupt activities.
These might include negotiating a legitimate bank loan.
The corrupt official will weigh these costs vis-a-vis the benefits.
The higher the costs of corruption, the less the demand for corruption will be In general, therefore, demand for corruption varies inversely with its costs and on a cost-corruption panel, demand for corruption is, therefore, downward-sloping.
(Sketch this graph for yourself).
3.2.4 Expected Punishment Since corruption is often a criminal act, it is punishable directly by law.
The punishment can also be indirect by social disapproval and disgrace.
A rational corrupt official will, therefore, assess the potential punishment, if and when apprehended, on two bases: (a) the severity, and (b) the probability.
3.2.5 Economic Incentives to be Corrupt In an economic system, positive incentives may be created for corruption.
This is often the case when governmental controls or interventions in the economic system create bureaucratic inefficiency.
Consider the case of official efforts to conserve foreign exchange.
191  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Fig.
2: Economic incentives for corruption: case of allocation of import licenses for stockfish One of the ways of doing this is by allocation of import licenses for the importation of a commodity.
Fig.2 illustrates this in the case of stockfish.
Normal profit is earned at e if there is no administrative control in the importation of stockfish.
Now, if the government restricts importation to Q by the allocation of import licenses, people would be willing to pay c P .
This would result in a monopoly profit of P P M|M for holders of m e m 2 import licenses.
This in turn will generate the incentive for bribery or another form of corrupt activity to obtain the license.
If a typical importer incurs a bribery cost of P PoMoM to obtain an import license, e 2 there would still be a profit of P M|MoP - Since this type of import m 0 control is common in several African countries, positive incentives exist for corruption.
When it is recalled that the control of one item may necessitate the control of another, the tendency for corruption to multiply is easily appreciated.
Furthermore, inefficiencies in the bureaucratic system tend to encourage mutual collaboration in corruption between the officials and the clients.
To obtain an urgent passport in a congested office would be virtually impossible if the applicant does not bribe the official to speed it up.
In general, therefore, administrative inefficiency in the economic system tends to generate corrupt practices because of positive incentives to bribe corrupt officials.
Where corruption is extensive in an economic system, productive workers tend to be rewarded with inadequate or even negative incentives.
192 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.2.6 Level of Individual’s Income In an economy where individual earnings are inadequate to meet basic needs and social responsibilities, there is indirect pressure to be corrupt.
This situation is common in many LDCs.
Consider a top official on a salary of N2.7 million per annum.
Ordinarily, this salary should be enough for family needs.
But some cultures expect such an official to spend a huge amount on social functions, to educate relations, etc.
These social responsibilities create pressure on officials to live beyond their means.
One way of obtaining more money is through corrupt practices.
Generally, poverty is a great driver of corruption.
Thus, the poorer the individual or the society, the more the incidence of corruption, ceteris paribus.
The deepening poverty in Africa has been associated with rising incidence of corruption.
3.2.7 Income Distribution Where distribution of income is highly inequitable, those on the lower scale often find it difficult to meet their most basic needs.
The pressure to escape poverty may lead to a corrupt life.
This may be abetted by the rich few who will bribe the poor to, for example, sell their votes.
In this way, the rich few can use political power to maintain a system of economic inequality by corrupting the masses.
This experience is quite common in most African societies with highly skewed income distribution.
3.3 Economic Effects of Corruption Corruption would not be considered a social problem worthy of analytical and policy attention if its effects on the economic system were neutral.
As we shall show presently, corruption significantly retards developing economies.
Let us discuss some of these negative impacts briefly.
3.3.1 Increase in Economic Crime Our theoretical analysis relating demand for corruption to its net gains, costs of operations and expected punishment offer a straightforward explanation for increase in criminal behaviour.
This is because an economically rational official who is corrupt will always undertake related criminal activities to minimise the costs or punishment arising from corrupt behaviour.
This goes towards explaining why some law enforcement agents are bribed, public buildings burnt down in order to burn the records of corrupt transactions, and murders committed to keep someone from revealing incriminating evidence.
The economic costs of 193  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS these related crimes, especially those of arson and murder, can be enormous if quantified.
3.3.2 Reduction in the Supply of Public Goods Extensive corruption may lead to a reduction in the supply of public goods.
Take the case of police protection as a typical example.
Suppose corruption is allowed to permeate the rank and file of the police force.
This would mean that innocent citizens would have no effective protection against crimes; therefore, murderers, extortionists, rapists, etc.
would thrive.
The same effect could apply to the political system whose essential role is to legislate for the public good.
A corrupt political leadership can saddle the nation with making anti-developmental legislation since their intention would be that of self-protection.
Here, political power becomes an instrument for reducing the cost and maximising the gains from corruption.
3.4 Corruption Indexes Corruption indexes are measures that summarise one or more aspects of corruption-related phenomena.
The characters that are the object of measurement may be aspects of corruption proper, or they may represent occurrences that are understood to be correlated with corruption, such as “public integrity” or various measures of the quality of governance.
Most times, such indexes are based on perceptions of the phenomena.
This is the case of Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, the result of the aggregation of several other indexes, and the Global Corruption Barometer that Transparency International commissioned to Gallup, focusing more on petty corruption.
Other indexes are based on descriptions of broad aspects of governance, and as such are more tenuously linked with the corruption phenomenon.
The three types of assessment of corruption may present some degree of simultaneity.
A high public opinion exposure to media coverage on scandals may cause an artificial increase on perception-based indexes.
For example, Italy’s ranking in the 1995 Transparency International CPI was below Mexico and Colombia, and just above Thailand, India and The Philippines.
Such an unrealistic ranking is probably at least in part explained by the spate of attention that the corruption issue had received in Italy in the early 1990’s, corresponding to the so called “Tangentopoli” judicial inquiries.
Perception-based corruption indexes could also influence corruption perception, given the wide dissemination they receive from the media, raising the possibilities that they influence 194 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS the very same perceptions on which they are based.
Judicial activity may also be influenced by the perception of corruption, either of the informal type, or as expressed by an index, wherever the judiciary has degrees of freedom in allocating its effort.
3.5 Solutions to Corruption Corruption everywhere is usually frowned upon as immoral and criminal.
Public condemnation of corruption in Nigeria, for instance, dates back to the colonial era.
In its Civil Service General Orders, the colonial government stipulated that any employee found guilty of corruption would be dismissed.
The Nigerian Criminal Code treats corruption as a criminal offence punishable under the law.
When the late General Murtala Mohammed took over power in 1975, he purged the country's public service of ‘'corrupt’ officials through mass dismissals.
As a follow up, the Code of Conduct and Public Complaints Commission were set up with branches throughout all the states of the Federation to fight corruption.
The 1979 and 1999 Constitutions of Nigeria make it mandatory for public office holders to declare their assets before taking up office and at the end of their tenure.
In 1982, President Shehu Shagari set up the Ethical Reorientation Committee to study the problem of a drastic fall in ethical standards among Nigerians in order to usher in an ethical revolution.
In 1999, the government set up the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (1CPC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to combat corruption.
It is a matter for concern that despite these attempted solutions, corruption is perceived to be on the increase in Nigeria.
Indeed, ‘corruption paradox’ whereby its incidence varies with anti-corruption measures seems to hold sway.
Most people agree that it poses a fundamental threat to the survival of the Nigerian economy.
This view may not be far from the truth if corruption is found to be endemic or systemic.
One of the reasons for the failure of existing policies is the lack of economic focus.
Corruption is seen mainly in moralistic and legalistic terms; hence the proposed solutions are morally and/or legally oriented.
Our theoretical analysis, however, suggests that corruption is essentially an economic problem and, consequently, effective solutions must be looked for in the economic realm.
Besides, the extant solution approaches tend to treat the symptoms rather than the fundamental causes of corruption.
Success in tackling corruption needs to be both preventive and therapeutic.
195  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.5.1 Reduction of Net Gains to Corruption Since net gains are what lure people into corruption, these can be reduced or completely eliminated by stepping up the costs of corruption.
Such costs should include the public condemnation of ill-gotten wealth and the plugging of legal loopholes that corrupt officials tend to exploit.
A non-police intelligence network comprising proven patriots can help in checking corrupt officials.
To encourage efficiency, such patriotic volunteers should be rewarded by government through a ‘whistle blowing’ programme.
Thus, whoever 'blows the whistle’ to alert authorities of corruption deals can be rewarded handsomely.
3.5.2 Increase in the Probability of Punishment More resources should be given to law enforcement agents to enable them to improve their efficiency in apprehending and punishing corrupt officials.
It follows logically that the higher the probability of getting caught and punished after committing the crime, the lower will be the incidence of corruption.
In particular, stiff penalties should always be meted out to corrupt officials as a deterrent.
3.5.3 Elimination of Corruption Incentives and Uneconomic Subsidies Incentives for corruption can be eliminated or minimised in the economic system through less administrative controls of the market process.
Where such controls are inevitable, efficient administrative machinery should be set up in order to prevent the operation of the 'underground economy'.
There is need to review the system of subsidies to eliminate those that encourage corruption.
3.5.4 Fighting Poverty Since corruption thrives on absolute poverty, one of the solutions lies in the reduction of poverty.
The most effective way of doing this is to adopt the basic needs approach to development.
This strategy ensures that basic human needs like adequate food, water, shelter, medical facilities, etc.
are provided for the masses.
This will render them less susceptible to the corrupting influence of the rich or corrupt politicians.
A market-based approach to ensuring provision of basic needs is to promote productive employment described below.
3.5.5 Education Efforts should be made to raise the literacy rate to enable citizens to gain knowledge about their rights in society.
The basic school curricula 196 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS should include moral instruction, ethics and civil rights.
Corruption should be a subject in the curricula of schools with emphasis on accountability.
3.5.6 Private Provision of Public Goods Experience has shown that governments' efforts to provide public goods are often prone to corruption.
This can be avoided by contracting the provision of public goods like electricity, water supply, roads, etc, to private limited liability companies.
Corruption would be minimised under this arrangement because of their relative efficiency compared to the government.
To avoid exploitation of the public by these private monopolies, an effective regulatory mechanism should, however, be put in place.
3.5.7 Promoting Productive Employment Productive employment means getting a job or means of livelihood that yields sustainable income streams for meeting people's basic needs.
A high rate of unemployment, underemployment or low-wage employment tends to exacerbate corruption.
A programme for promoting job creation or self-employment should receive the priority attention of governments.
Having a legitimate means of livelihood will tend to enlist support of the public for the fight against corruption.
This is because productively employed/ engaged people have a stake in living in a corruption-free environment.
3.5.8 Efficient Bureaucracy and Economic Management Improvements in bureaucratic efficiency as well as general management efficiency will tend to eliminate corruption.
This is because merit and productivity would be the yardsticks for reward.
Improvement in productive efficiency, especially of the industrial system, can indirectly reduce the incentives to smuggling since product quality would be enhanced and the prices reduced.
3.5.9 Reduction in Income and Wealth Inequality Measures to reduce distributional inequality such as taxation and income transfer programmes to the poor, would minimise corruption.
If the income gap is drastically reduced, the urge to get rich by corrupt means can be minimised correspondingly.
197  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.5.10 Corruption Monitoring Agencies set up by government to monitor corruption face many problems that have undermined their effectiveness.
If government is serious about fighting corruption, agencies such as ICPC, EFCC, etc, should not only be staffed with highly dedicated and motivated professionals but should be adequately funded and resourced.
They should in turn fight corruption not only through the demand (therapeutic) but through the supply strategies.
From the supply perspective, its focus should be on undertaking rigorous research- probing the fundamental causes of corruption and setting up appropriate internal corruption monitoring mechanism.
Such a monitoring system can highlight the shortcomings of an externally located monitoring such as Transparency International.
It would also contribute to enriching the perspective of TICI findings.
SELF ASSESSMENT EXERCISE Look at the statements below and decide if they are true or false.
1.
Corrupt administrative practices are more likely to be found in a state which takes on functions that it does not have the capacity to carry out.
2.
Shortages of essential commodities because of inadequate foreign exchange are likely to lead to unofficial market arrange- ments sometimes operating outside the law.
3.
Socialist societies rarely have unofficial markets.
4.
Unofficial markets are a rational economic response to price control during times of shortages.
5.
Where import tariffs are low and demand for imports high, there is less likely to be unofficial markets in imported commodities.
4.0 CONCLUSION Corruption has been known to exist in various forms in both developed and developing societies as well as in all ideological systems.
5.0 SUMMARY In this unit we have learnt the followings.
• Demand for corruption is determined by a complex set of economic forces.
These include net gains from corruption, costs of engaging in corrupt acts, expected punishments, existence of 198 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS economic incentives for corruption, level of individual income, income distribution and level of education • The effects of corruption include an increase in economic crime, reduction in the supply of public goods, unemployment , increased costs of investments, balance of payments deficits, ineffective economic policy, income inequality, low utilisation of manpower, loss of human capital including lives, foreign debt burden, increased capital flight, reduced inflow of foreign direct investment and political instability, increased poverty and reduced economic growth.
• Solutions to corruption should focus on the moralistic or legalistic as well as therapeutic angles • The economic approaches worth considering include: reduction in net gains of corruption by increasing its cost of operation, increase in the probability and severity of punishment, elimination of corruption incentives in the socio-bureaucratic system; fighting absolute poverty by provision of basic needs for the masses; provision of mass education to increase awareness to social rights; promotion of productive employment; efficient economic and bureaucratic management; reduction in income inequality.

The arguments for economic liberalisation include greater efficiency and effectiveness that would translate to a "bigger pie" for everybody.
Most first world countries, in order to remain globally competitive, have pursued the path of economic liberalisation: partial or full privatisation of government institutions and assets, greater labour-market flexibility, lower tax rates for businesses, less restriction on both domestic and foreign capital, open markets, etc.
In developing countries, economic liberalisation refers more to liberalisation or further “opening up” of their respective economies to foreign capital and investments.
Three of the fastest growing developing economies today; China, Brazil and India, have achieved rapid economic growth in the past several years or decades after they have “liberalized” their economies to foreign capital.
201  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 2.0 OBJECTIVES By the end of this unit, you should be able to: • define liberalisation as an economic concept • explain liberalisation and its benefits to the economy • identify the objectives of competition policy and law • identify the impact of liberalisation on the workforce.
3.0 MAIN CONTENT 3.1 The Definition of Liberisation Liberalisation means the opening up of markets within and between countries to promote "free trade", i.e.
reducing barriers to trade such as tariffs (import and export duties) and other forms of regulation.
Liberalisation also, in many circumstances, means freedom to exploit, due to this reduction in regulations and standards that are universally adhered to.
3.2 What Economic Liberalisation and Globalisation Means for the Masses The subject of “Economic Liberalisation” and “Globalisation” has attracted the attention of the people both at home and abroad.
A layman speculates “Economic Liberalisation” as a subsidy granted by the Government to big houses.
Economic liberalisation means modernisation, upgrading of technology, large production, development of sunrise industries like electronics and improvement in the working of public sector enterprises so that the levels of productivity may be improved.
All this would come about with the cordial principle of liberalisation.
Under “Economic Liberalisation”, a review of the various economic controls has been made and counter productive controls are being dispensed with.
The industrial licensing policy, trade policy, taxation policy or, in a broader context, the entire fiscal policy, monetary policy, agricultural policy etc.
are being cast in a manner so as to sub serve the goals of higher production and productivity.
These liberalisations are designed to initiate measures aimed at increasing international competitiveness of developing country’s goods and services and hence their exports.
They also encourage in flow of foreign exchange into their private foreign direct investment.
The economic Liberalisation policy has provided for encouraging private foreign direct investment in setting up joint ventures with their business 202 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS houses in the field of trading with equity contributions of up to 51% in these ventures.
The shift of emphasis in the economic liberalisation is towards greater reliance on the private sector for increasing the production in future.
For this purpose, economic controls and regulations have been gradually relaxed and will be further relaxed with the passage of time.
The liberalisation policy emphasises economics of large-scale production, modernisation and competition for production in the economy.
Although the process of economic liberalisation had commenced in 1973, but this process gathered momentum and it is difficult to predict the future shape of things in this regard.
The direction is now more certain and the speed is faster towards economic Liberalisation in developing country.
Broadly speaking, liberalisation policy is a move from the public sector towards the private sector.
It emphasises production and productivity maximisation goals, rather than the mere idealistic talk of socialistic pattern of society.
The true meaning of the term “globalisation,” its core contents, and its impact on the economies and societies in both developed and developing countries, have been a vigorously contested subject for a long time now.
This debate reminds one of the stories of the elephant and the seven blind men.
Each person touched a separate part of the pachyderm’s anatomy, and depending upon the contours of that part, described the complete animal, with his imagination taking over where his visual faculty left off.
The message of this allegory is not that the narratives were inherently flawed in their analytical conception.
Rather, that globalisation is dynamic, so complex and still unfolding that one account of it could be at significant variance with another, and yet both might be offering true but partial accounts of the overall phenomenon.
Indeed, in contemporary international discourse, this term is often bandied about as a new phenomenon.
In reality, globalisation has long been a feature of the international system, whether it relates to transmigration of people, cross-fertilisation of ideas, or even trans- mutation of technologies.
What has changed distinctively in recent decades is the pace and scope of globalisation.
And as its most powerful manifestation, advanced technology runs through the increasing jigsaw of the international system as a lubricant, imparting its liquidity as well as dynamism.
Thus, the distinctive aspect of contemporary globalisation is the increase in its liquidity, which makes it a phenomenon, capable of tremendous progress but also of considerable harm.
203  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Further, despite the controversy, most experts agree that at its core, globalisation denotes the international integration of the basic factors of production, i.e.
labour, capital, technology, and entrepreneurship, and their output, i.e.
goods and services.
As national economies become increasingly integrated into the global economic matrix, it blurs the traditional boundaries between local, national and trans-national, and impinges crucially upon the latitude, jurisdiction, and sovereignty of state actors in the international system.
By comparison, the concept of “economic liberalisation” is relatively simpler to comprehend, even if not easy for governments to implement and sustain over the time.
In essence, economic liberalisation denotes an attitudinal change along with changes in the structures and processes of an economy that was hitherto “closed” to the international markets.
In attitudinal terms, this means change in the role of the government from one of a “chief controller” to that of “facilitator” and an “arbiter” of competing economic groups and interests within a country.
The structural and procedural derivatives of liberalisation signify the entire gamut of changes that result from the deliberate policies of governments to permit a greater role for market forces in the functioning of economy.
The economic liberalisation policy is within the parameters of change allowed in the economic management of the nation.
It will help in improving the growth performance of the economy and will reduce poverty and unemployment in the country.
3.3 Basic Assumptions That free trade, competition, and the laws of supply and demand will regulate the market sufficiently well to provide economic growth, employment and prosperity for all.
Inefficiency will be reduced, as companies have to be efficient to stay competitive.
Participation in the global economy is expected to raise the living standards in poor countries as MNC investment brings jobs, monetary income and an increase in consumer goods.
“Comparative advantage” is a theory which states that nations should specialise in producing what they are best at producing, and that they should then trade with other nations.
Export-orientated growth should be encouraged.
204 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS 3.3.1 Basic Problems Quite clearly, liberalisation has not brought prosperity or employment for all.
This may be partly because it has not been applied fairly but it is also because not everyone starts on an equal footing.
In a world with reduced trade barriers, small companies cannot hope to compete fairly with the economic might, technical expertise and marketing power of huge Multinational Corporations (MNCs).
Thus true competition gives way to monopolisation in many cases.
3.4 Trade Liberalisation and Competition Policy The process of economic liberalisation started in several countries across the world during 1980s and 1990s.
This was when most of the countries adopted policies of deregulation, privatisation and trade liberalisation.
This was also the time when the World Trade Organisation (WTO) came into being.
The WTO is a bundle of several agreements on goods and services, with various rules on how they are produced and traded, ensuring that there is healthy competition in the global market place.
However, this is not enough, and therefore, at times, there was strong demand for competition rules to be integrated in the international trading system.
Trade and economic liberalisation aided competition in the market, by increasing the basket of goods and services with better quality and lower prices.
Yet, anti-competitive practices undertaken by economic players or induced by inappropriate government policies have negated the gains of liberalisation.
With the adoption of market oriented reforms, there were several players in the market resulting in competition.
But at the same time, many abuses too creep into the system.
In order to balance the system, price controls and market regulations were put in place.
But by and large they proved ineffective.
This is why countries adopted competition and economic regulatory laws to promote a healthy market and economic democracy.
The main objective of competition policy and law is to preserve and promote competition as a means of ensuring the efficient allocation of resources in an economy.
This should eventually result in fair prices and adequate supplies for consumers and, it is hoped, faster growth and a more equitable distribution of income.
While going through a phase of privatisation and deregulation, often monopoly power is transferred from the public to the private sector which harms the interests of consumers, especially the poor.
This situation requires an appropriate regulatory mechanism.
International anti-competitive practices can also be harmful to small and developing countries without effective competition laws.
Cross-border mergers and acquisitions that lead to 205  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS market dominance and the restrictive practices that some trans-national corporations engage in, also further necessitate competition rules.
Competition policy also promotes good governance in the corporate sector as well as in governments by diminishing the opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour and the corruption that often accompanies it.
Competition law and regulatory tools are invoked mainly to take care of firms’ behaviour and market failures.
Governments often intervene when markets fail but in the absence of a clearly defined competition policy and regulatory mechanisms, the intervention can be arbitrary and serve vested interests rather than the poor.
It regulates the economic activity within the country by protecting business and consumers against abuses of economic power and promoting efficiency and consumer welfare.
Further, competition law provides necessary safeguard against arbitrary decision-making, apart from dealing with anti-competitive business practices by such investors.
Investment through the M&A route is another area where there is significant interaction between investment and competition policy.
3.5 Impact of Liberalisation on the Workforce Considering the Indian Economy: the liberalisation of the Indian economy started in 1991, with the government’s attempts to decontrol the economy and open Indian markets to the rest of the world.
Its perceived or projected impact was certainly faster economic progress for the country.
Its needs were debated and re-debated for long by everyone in the intelligentsia.
All those who considered themselves as custodians of values, culture, and nationalism, voiced its likely impact.
All those who considered themselves as saviours of the workforce, debated its impact on likely unemployment.
For long, it remained an important topic at top B & E schools for group discussions.
However, during this phase of debating the pros and cons of liberalisation, one thing which I did not hear, was “How will it impact the workforce?” Today, more than a decade after the start of liberalisation, this impact is being debated.
Visible outcomes (i) Accelerated movement of the workforce to so called new economy and geographic dislocations.
(ii) More choices/options (to save, spend, or store).
(iii) Higher speed of change (products, people, or possibilities).
(iv) Survival of the powerful (money, manipulation, muscle).
Here the word powerful has replaced ‘the fittest’.
(v) Higher degree of information.
206 DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS Each one of these areas had visible outcomes and has affected/impacted the workforce both positively and adversely in the following areas.
a. Competency Level The old manual skill based worker dominance is changing to knowledge based worker dominance.
It is changing the whole process of supervision and governance.
Further, rate of redundancy or competency is increasing.
Required skill sets change with changing technology.
In order to remain current and employable, the workforce is constantly on the look out for latest skill sets.
As a result, their attention is divided in doing the job and acquiring new skills.
This is leading to the demand for being associated with newer technologies and unidirectional job rotations.
This has also led to job-hopping at faster rate and lack of workforce with mature or high levels of competency.
At the same time, it is becoming a knowledgeable world today; more and more people are becoming domain experts.
Along with high competency levels in specific domains, the workforce today is extremely flexible and has phenomenal capacity to adapt or shift its domain expertise.
Outsourcing the most talked of and used phenomenon today has resulted from economies of volumes and domain expertise in specific areas.
The workforce today is more informed and is also well-versed with the latest trends and technological value-adds, it is thereby in a position to provide better services and efforts.
However, faster rate of technology adoption than assimilation has created a sharp divide in the competency base of haves and have-nots.
We are coming into an era where “a specialist in a specialised field is transforming into a generalist who is capable of performing specialist activity.” b.
Work Habits Changing work environment, personal demands and social fabrics are causing changes in work habits.
Further, the fear of losing a job amongst knowledgeable workers makes them work more as individuals rather than teams.
Availability of information through net-surfing is making knowledgeable workers to adopt cut and paste methodology rather than being genuine and creative.
Due to shorter service spans, the habit of managing the situation rather than managing job with mid and long-term perspective is creeping in.
Demand to “prove fast or move” by employers due to high competition and cost pressures coupled with inadequate business monitoring scenario (where overall enterprise management, strict process and legal 207  DAM363 ECONOMIC STATISTICS controls are still not mature) at times force the workforce to adopt shortcuts.
On the positive note, the cut and paste habits can be seen as a habit of plug and play components.
This enables the informed and intellectual workforce to produce innovative creations.
In this intensely competitive era, the rat race for being “the first mover” has reached its peak.
This has created desire amongst the workforce to be more innovative than repetitive when it comes to their work.
Habit of reinventing the wheel is disappearing.
Research reports have revealed that this “well informed and current in every aspect of the workforce” is able to do a mask and portray themselves in an extremely positive light, thus easily faking expertise and experiences at selection.
This, at times, results in poor performance and is a great source of dismay for employers.
Today’s workforce is ready to don the mantle of “Entrepreneur” and go all out for its goals.
Delegation and participative management with flattering organisational structures are becoming today’s mantras to suit current work habits.
Though this brand of “entrepreneurship” is welcome, it comes coupled with increased levels of indiscipline and disrespect to organisational systems or procedures and policies.
c. Psychological Impact Liberalisation has impacted longevity of business and product cycles adversely.
This has led to quicker starting and winding up of businesses.
Automation has improved productivity and made many jobs redundant.
Thus the workforce is under a constant threat of: • Loss of jobs—high rate of downsizing, right sizing; • Faster rate of skill redundancy (increasing need of new skill sets); • Hire and fire policies; • Continuous struggle to prove one’s worth; • Transfer to new geographic locations; • Negative changes in remuneration and benefits; • Constantly changing peers, supervisors and subordinates (working with new people).
Even the stars of recent past are highly insecure and unsure of themselves.
This all has given rise to high degree of stress and stress related psychological disorders.
Liberalisation has resulted in a wholly new “call centre industry” that has opened its doors to the younger generation.
Here employees and employers face a totally different set of challenges.
