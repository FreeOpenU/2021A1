They have –OH group (a hydroxyl) bonded to a saturated alkane like carbon atom R- OH where R is any simple alkyl or substituted alkyl group.
For example: CH OH CH CH OH 3 3 2 methanol ethanol CH -CH-CH OH 3 2 CH 3 2-methyl propan-1-ol 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: (a) Classify alcohols into monohydric, dihydric and polyhydric (b) Classify monohydric alcohols into primary(1o),secondary(2o) and tertiary(3o) alcohols (c) Draw the structure of simple alcohols (d) Give the names of alcohols using the IUPAC system 3.0 Classes of Alcohols Alcohols can contain one or more hydroxyl group.
It could be: i. Monohydric – contain only one hydroxyl group.
For example, ethanol.
CH -CH -CH -OH 3 2 2 Ethanol ii.
Dihydr ic- contain two hydroxyl groups.
For example ethane-1,2-diol.
CH – CH 2 2 | | OH OH iii.
Trihydr ic- contains three hydroxyl groups.
For example, propane-1, 2, 3-triol.
Generally with more than one hydroxyl group, it is said to be polyhydric.
Monohydric alcohols have the general formula C H OH.
They can be classified into three n 2n + 1 classes - primary (1o), secondary (2o) and tertiary alcohol (3o) according to the number of alkyl groups attached to the hydroxyl-bonded carbon atom.
(i) Primary alcohol (l°) It has one alkyl group attached to the hydroxyl bonded carbon atom.
H |  6 R — C—OH | H For example, CH OH CH CH OH 3 3 2 Methanol Ethanol CH H 3 | | CH —C— C—OH 3 | | CH H 3 2,2-dimethylpropan-1-ol Secondary alcohol (2o): There are two alkyl groups attached to the hydroxyl-bonded carbon atom.
R’ | R— C—OH | H For example: CH CH 2 3 | CH —C—OH 3 | H Butan-2-ol CH 3 | CH —C—OH 3 | H Propan-2-ol Tertiary (3o): There are three alkyl groups, but no hydrogen atom directly attached to the hydroxyl-bonded carbon atom.
R’ | R— C—OH | R” For example: CH 3  7 | CH —C—OH 3 | CH 3 2—methyl propan—2—ol CH CH 2 3 | CH CH —C—OH 3 2 | CH 3 3—methylpentan—3—ol ACTIVITY A/Self Assessment Exercise (i) Draw the structure of the following alcohols and classify each as1° 2° or 3° alcohol.
(i) Butan—1—o1 (ii) 2—methylpentan—2—ol (iii) Pentan—2—ol 3.1 Naming Alcohols a.
Common names Simple alcohols are often called by their common names which consists of the name of the alkyl group to which the –OH group is attached followed by the word ‘alcohol’.
For example, CH OH CH CH OH CH CHOH 3 3 2 3 Methyl alcohol Ethyl alcohol | CH 3 Isopropyl alcohol b. IUPAC names In the IUPAC system, alcohols are named as alkanols and their names are derived from the parent alkane by replacing the ‘e’ from the parent hydrocarbon and adding the suffix ‘ol’.
For example: CH CH OH CH CH CH OH 3 2 3 2 2 Ethanol Propanol For a cyclic alcohol, the –ol ending is added to the parent cycloalkane.
For example, OH | Cyclohexanol  8 c. Glycols  9 Dialcohols or diols are called glycols.
They are named as derivatives of the parent hydrocarbon with the –diol name ending added.
The –OH groups are added as prefixes.
For example: OH | HOCH CH OH CH CH CH —CH— CH —CH OH 2 2 3 2 2 2 2 1, 2—Ethanediol 1, 3—hexanediol Activity B/Self Assessment Exercise Give systematic names for the following compounds (i) CH CH CH CHCH CH 3 2 2 2 3 | OH (ii) −OH | OH (iii) CH CHCH OH 3 2 CH OH 3 | | (iv) CH CHCH CHCH CH 3 2 2 3 3.2 Physical Properties of Alcohols 3.2.1 Physical Appearance Most simple alcohols are liquid at room temperature.
Alcohols with more than twelve carbon atoms are waxy solid at room temperature.
3.2.2 Melting and boiling point Like the parent hydrocarbon, the boiling points among the alcohols increase steadily with increase in the number of carbon atoms.
The boiling point of alcohols are very high compared with that of the corresponding alkane because of their ability to form hydrogen bond between the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group and the oxygen atom of another molecule The influence of the —OH group however becomes less significant as the carbon skeleton increases.
The order of boiling points of isomeric alcohols is 1° alcohol >2° alcohols >3° alcohols.
10 3.2.3 Density The density of alcohols increases with increasing relative molecular mass, however, branching can reduce this effect.
All simple alcohols are less dense than water, but the aromatic homologues are slightly denser than water.
3.2.4 Solubility Hydrogen bonding in alcohols influences their solubility in water.
Alcohols with a relatively short carbon skeleton are soluble in water.
For example methane, ethanol, propan-1-o1 and propan-2-o1 are completely miscible with water in all chains increases, the solubility of alcohols drop drastically.
All alcohols are miscible with most organic solvents such as hexane, benzene and ethanol; the smaller ones are useful organic solvents.
Activity C/Self Assessment Exercise Arrange the following in increasing order of solubility: 2-methyl propan-1-ol, ethanol, butan-1-ol 4.0 Conclusion Alcohols can be monohydric, dihydric or trihydric.
Monohydric alcohol can be further classified into primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols and the simple ones are miscible with water because of H-bonding.
The names of alcohols are derived from the parent hydrocarbon by replacing the ‘e’ from the name of the parent alkane with ‘-ol’.
5.0 Summary In this unit we have learnt that: i. Alcohols are compounds in which a hydrogen of alkane has been replaced by an -OH group ii.
Alcohol can be monohydric, dihydric, trihydric or polyhydric iii.
Monohydric alcohols can be classified into 1o, 2o and 3o alcohol iv.
In naming alcohols, the ‘e’ from the corresponding alkane is replaced with ‘ol’.

All halogenoalkane when heated under reflux with aqueous potassium hydroxide solution are hydrolysed to yield an alcohol RX + KOH ROH + X- reflux Where X= I , Br , Cl and R= alkyl group The ease of reaction of the halogenoalkanes follows the order RI > RBr > RCl 3.2 Hydration of alkene This reaction is simply the addition of water molecule to the alkene to form the corresponding alcohol.
It involves the addition of concentrated tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid first to the alkene to give alkyl hydrogen tetraoxosulphate (VI) which when treated with water (hydrolysis), gives an alcohol.
For example, the formation of ethanol: CH = CH + H SO CH − CH HOSO + H 2 2 2 4 3 2 3 2 conc .

3.4 Fermentation of carbohydrates Industrially, ethanol can be prepared from the fermentation of carbohydrates.
The biological catalysts, enzymes, found in yeast maltase break down the sugar molecules into ethanol to give a yield which is in the region of 95 per cent.

The percentage of ethanol can  17 be increased by distillation of the reaction product: to give a mixture containing 95.5 by mass of ethanol and 4.43% water.
The mixture is called rectified spirit with a constant boiling point of 78.2°C.
Anhydrous calcium chloride cannot be used to remove the residual water because it reacts with alcohols to form compounds of the types CaCl .
nC H OH.
On distilling over 2 2 5 quicklime, CaO, which reacts with only the water but not with the alcohol, absolute alcohol (99.5% alcohol) is obtained.
The last traces of water can be removed from this by refluxing it with metallic calcium and redistilling.
Absolute is ethanol is highly hygroscopic and must be stored away from atmospheric moisture if its purity is to be maintained.
4.0 Conclusion Alcohol can be prepared in the laboratory using diverse methods as discussed above, however fermentation of carbohydrates can be used for the industrial preparation 5.0 Summary In this unit we have learnt that: (i) alcohols can be prepared from the hydrolysis of halogenoalkanes (ii) alcohols can be prepared from the hydration of alkene (iii) alcohols can be prepared from the reduction of aldehydes and ketones using - RLi - RMgX - LiAlH 4 - LiBH 4 (iv) alcohols can be prepared from the fermentation of carbohydrates (v) Rectified Spirit is a mixture of 95.57% ethanol.

They undergo diverse reactions depending on the position of cleavage of the bond, RO- H or R-OH forming an alkoxide ion or forming a carbonium ion respectively 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: (a) Discuss the acidity of alcohol compared with that of water (b) Explain the amphoteric nature of alcohols (c) Discuss the various reactions of alcohols, stating the necessary conditions of reaction.
3.0 Acidity of Alcohols Alcohols have no effect on pH paper or sodium hydroxide.
A measurement of the pH value of ethanol with a pH meter shows that ethanol is neutral.
Alcohols are actually amphoteric in nature.
As an acid, it ionizes to form an alkoxide ion (RO) and hydrogen ion, H+ in the presence of a base.
ROH RO¯ + H+ The acidic strength of alcohol follow the order: 1° alcohol > 2° alcohol > 3°alcohol.
In the presence of an acid, the alcohol may function as a base; it can accept a proton as shown below: ROH + H+ ROH+ The basic strength of alcohols follow the order 3° alcohol > 2° alcohol > 1° alcohol Water is a weak acid, however the acidic strength of alcohols are much weaker than that of water.
For example, considering the equilibrium for the ionization of water and the ionization of ethanol: H2O + H2O HO¯ + H3O+ Kα = 1.0 x 10-18 Hydroxide ion CH3CH2OH + H2O CH3CH2O¯ + H3O+ Kα = 1.0 x 10-16 Ethoxide ion This shows that water is a stronger acid than ethanol.
Aromatic alcohols, for example C H CH OH, behave in a similar way as tertiary aliphatic 6 5 2 alcohol because of the electron donating properties of the benzene ring.
Activity A/Self Assessment Exercise 1.
Arrange the following in increasing acidic strength Methanol, Water, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, ethanol 3.1 Reactions of Alcohols  20 3.1.1 Combustion Alcohols burn in air to give carbon (IV) oxide and water.
For example, when ethanol burns in air with a pale blue flame to give carbon (IV) oxide and water.
C H OH + 3O 2CO + 3H O.
2 5 2 2 2 3.1.2 Reactions based on position cleavage of bond in alcohol Apart from combustion, alcohols undergo many other reactions and the type of reaction depends on the position of cleavage of the bond.
There are two likely position of cleavage, giving two categories of reactions (i) Cleavage of R-OH For example: R-OH → R+ + OH (ii) Cleavage of RO-H For example: RO-H → RO¯ + H+ Either of these reactions may yield the substitution or elimination product and usually a mixture of the two depending mainly on the nature of the alkyl group to which the hydroxyl group is attached.
The preferred position of cleavage for 1°, 2°, and 3° alcohols shown below: R-CH –O — H 2 A- Primary alcohol R CH ——— O ——— H R B- Secondary alcohol or R R C ——— O —— H R C- Tertiary alcohol represents the position of cleavage  21 In A, the lower +I (I means inductive effect) effect from one alky group favors the formation the alkoxide ion, RCH O¯ while in C the greater +I effect from three alkyl groups stabilizes 2 the intermediate carbonium ion, R C+ .
3 3.1.2.1 Reactions involving R—OH cleavage.
The order of reactivity is as follows 3°alcohol >2°alcohol>1° alcohol.
a. Halogenations The reaction is a nucleophilic substitution reaction.
i. Chlorination (Lucas test for alcohol) The reaction occurs when concentrated hydrochloric acid is put into absolute alcohol and then refluxed in the presence of an anhydrous zinc chloride as catalyst.
ZnCl cat 2 R—OH + HCl reflux R-Cl + H O 2 conc.
For example, CH CH OH + HCl ZnCl cat CH CH Cl + H O.
3 2 2 3 2 2 reflux The order of reactivity is as follows 3° > 2° > 1°alcohols.
An insoluble haloalkane will be formed and a cloudy mixture appears.
The time it takes for the cloudiness to appear and for separation into two distinct layers indicates the types of alcohol.
For 3° alcohols, two distinct layers are formed immediately, 2° alcohols forms two distinct layers in about 10minutes while for 1o alcohols, a cloudy appearance is noticed after refluxing for a few hours The reaction is believed to take place via the SN1 mechanism since concentrated hydrochloric acid is used.
| •• | | + —C— OH H+ — C— OH —C+ 2 | | | Cl | — C — Cl¯ | The stable the carbonium ion, the faster will the reaction rate be and the quicker is the time for appearance of cloudiness The stability of the carbonium ion is in the order below: R C+ > R C+H > RC+H 3 2 2  22 b. Bromination and iodination Different hydrogen halides will require different reagents, for example, (i) Use of NaX CH CH OH NaI, Conc H PO CH CH I + H O 3 2 3 4 3 2 2 Reflux CH CH OH NaBr, Conc H SO CH CH Br + H O 3 2 2 4 3 2 2 Reflux The order of reactivity is as follows HI > HBr > HCl (ii) Using phosphorus halides (PCl , PCl , PBr or PI ) 5 3 3 3 For example, use of phosphorus (V) chloride for chlorination.
This reaction can be carried out by adding solid phosphorus (V) chloride directly into the alcohol in a dry test tube.
For example: CH CH OH + PCl CH CH Cl + POCl + HCl 3 2 5 3 2 3 When phosphorus (III) chloride is used instead of phosphorus (V) chloride, the reaction is less vigorous.
3CH CH OH + PCl 3CH CH Cl + H PO 3 2 3 3 2 3 3 (iii) Using sulphur dichloride oxide (thionyl chloride, SOCl ) 2 Alcohol is refluxed with sulphur dichloride oxide (thionyl chloride) in the presence of a small quantity of pyridine, C H N, which serves to absorb the hydrogen chlorides as it is formed.
5 5 For example: CH CH OH + SOCl pyridine CH CH Cl + SO + HCl 3 2 2 3 2 2 iv.
Using phosphorus trihalide When alcohols react with phosphorus trihalide under reflux, the product is an haloalkane.
Phosphorus trihalide can be prepared easily by adding red phosphorus and a halogen to the reaction mixture under reflux.The products are obtained by distillation at the end of the reaction.
ROH red P/X RX + H PO 3 3 reflux alcohol haloalkane X = Br or Iodine  23 For example: CH CH CH OH red P/Br CH CH CH Br + H PO 3 2 2 3 2 2 3 3 reflux propan-1-ol 1-bromopropane c.Dehydration Dehydration of alcohols can be carried out by using dehydrating agents such as concentrated tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid or aluminum oxide to give the corresponding alkenes.
When alcohol vapour is passed over an aluminium oxide catalyst heated to 350°C or by heating to 170°C with excess concentrated tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid, the corresponding alkene is formed.
For example, the hydration of ethanol gives ethene.
CH CH OH excess H SO CH =CH + H O 3 2 2 4 2 2 2 170°C CH CH OH Al O CH =CH + H O 3 2 2 3 2 2 2 350°C Mechanism CH — CH — OH + H— O SOH CH CH —OH+ + HSO¯ 3 2 3 3 2 2 4 —H O 2 CH —CH + 3 2 HSO ¯ 4 CH =CH + H SO 2 2 2 4 The reaction above can only take place with alcohols that have at least one hydrogen on the adjacent carbon.
For example, methanol cannot undergo dehydration.
When the reaction involves secondary or tertiary alcohols having more than three carbon atoms, the possibility of forming more than one alkene can result from the dehydrated reaction.
For example, the dehydration of butan-2-ol gives but-1- ene and but -2- ene CH CH CHCH Conc.
H SO .
CH CH CH=CH + CH CH = CHCH 3 2 3 2 4 3 2 2 3 3 | But-1-ene But-2-ene OH The alkene produced in greater abundance is indicated by Saytzeff’s rule.
Saytzeff’s rule states that the alkene formed preferentially is the one containing the higher number of alkyl groups.
In the dehydration of butan-2-ol, the predominant product is but-2-ene.
24 Activity B/Self Assessment Excercise (a) In the dehydration of the following alkali, state the product(s) formed and indicate the major product when more than one product is possible.

(i) CH CH CHCH = CHCH (ii) CH CH = CH 3 2 3 3 2 | OH d. Formation of ethers When an excess alcohol is heated with concentrated tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid at a lower temperature of about 140°C ether is formed instead of alcohol.
The alcohol undergoes intermolecular dehydration forming ether.
For example, Mechanism 2CH CH OH Conc.
H SO CH CH OCH CH + H O 3 2 2 4 3 2 2 3 2 140°C ethoxyethane (ether) Mechanism CH CH OH + H CH CH OH + 3 2 3 2 2 -H O 2 CH CH OH + CH CH + 3 2 2 3 2 -H CH CH + + CH CH OH CH CH O+CH CH CH CH OCH CH 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 3 3 2 2 3 3.1.2.2 Reactions involving cleavage of RO-H The rate of reaction follows the order below: 1o alcohol > 2o alcohol > 3o alcohol a.
Reaction with reactive metals Alcohols react with reactive metals like sodium and potassium to form metal alkoxides and hydrogen gas.
For example: 2CH CH OH + 2Na 2CH CH ONa + H 3 2 3 2 2 Sodium ethaoxide  25 The metal alkoxides are stronger bases than sodium hydroxide; they are commonly used in organic reactions requiring a strong base in a non-aqueous solvent.
This reaction is similar to the reaction of water with reactive metals, however alcohols reacts more slowly with reactive metals than water 2H O + 2Na 2NaOH + H 2 2 Sodium hydroxide b.Esterification This is a reaction in which an alcohol reacts with carboxylic acid in the presence of concentrated tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid to form esters.
For example,the reaction of ethanol with ethanoic acid to form ethyl ethanoate and water.
CH CH OH + CH COOH H+ CH COOCH CH + H O 3 2 3 3 2 3 2 O Conc.H SO O 2 4 R – C + HOR´ R− C + H O 2 OH reflux OR´ Carboxylic acid alcohol Ester Esterification reaction is a rather slow reaction even with heating.
The reaction is reversible and the yield poor.
The forward reaction is called esterification while the backward reaction is called acid – catalysed hydrolysis of ester.
When excess acid or alcohol is added to the reaction mixture, the equilibrium will shift to the right hand side.
The formation of an ester can also be achieved by reacting with i. acyl chloride ii.

Oxidation of alcohols Alcohols can be oxidized by making use of common oxidizing agents such as acidified potassium tetraoxomanganate (VII) or acidified potassium heptaoxodichromate (VI) to give the corresponding carbonyl compound or carboxylic acid.
Primary alcohols are readily oxidized on heating to aldehydes but in the presence of excess of the oxidizing agent the reaction proceeds further to yield the carboxylic acid.
For example: [O] [O] CH CH OH CH CHO CH COOH 3 2 3 3 From KMnO 4 or K Cr O 2 2 7 Secondary alcohols are oxidized to the corresponding ketone.
Ketones are quite resistant to oxidation and do not undergo further reactions unless they are subjected to severe conditions.
In that case they are oxidized to a carboxylic acid- a mixture of smaller carboxylic acids will be formed because it involves breaking a carbon – carbon linkage.
CH CH 3 3 CHOH [O] C=O + H O 2 CH CH 3 3 Tertiary alcohols are also resistant to oxidation.
They are not oxidized at all in neutral or alkaline media.
In an acidic medium, tertiary alcohols undergo dehydration to the alkene which can be readily oxidized to the diol and further oxidation yields the oxidation products of primary alcohols.

Triiodoform Formation (Iodoform Reaction) Some alcohols with the structure H | −C−CH 3 | OH react with an iodoform reagent(iodine in the presence of sodium hydroxide), a mild oxidizing agents to give sodium carboxylate and triiodomethane(also called iodoform).
The product, triiodomethane appears as a yellow precipitate in the reaction mixture.

iii.
In the presence of an acid, the alcohol may function as a base; it can accept a proton as shown below: ROH + H+ ROH+ The basic strength of alcohols follow the order 3° alcohol > 2° alcohol > 1° alcohol iv.
Alcohols are much weaker acids than that of water.

They are n 2n +2 isomeric with the aliphatic monohydric alcohols with the general formula C H OH.
n 2n+1 Epoxides are formed when an oxygen atom is linked to carbon atoms of a carbon chain forming a three membered ring.
2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to: i.
Write the general formula of ethers and epoxides ii.
Draw the structures of ethers and epoxides iii.
Distinguish between symmetrical and unsymmetrical ethers iv.
Write the names of ethers using the IUPAC nomenclature v. State and draw the various isomers of ethers 3.0 Structures of Ethers Ethers possess the structure: R − O − R’.
R and R’ may be aliphatic or aromatic.
For example: CH – O – CH 3 3 Methoxymethane (Dimethyl ether) CH – O – CH CH 3 2 3 Methoxy ethane (Ethyl methyl ether) OCH 3 | −O− Methoxyl benzene Phenoxy benzene (Anisole) (Diphenyl ether) 3.1 Symmetrical and Unsymmetrical Ethers Symmetrical ethers are compounds in which R and R’ are identical, they are also known as simple ethers.
For example: CH – O – CH CH CH – O – CH CH 3 3 3 2 2 3 Methoxy methane Ethoxy ethane Unsymmetrical ethers are compounds in which R and R’ are different, they are also known as mixed ethers.
For example: CH - O- CH CH 3 2 3 Methoxyethane  35 3.2 Cyclic Ethers These are compound containing the oxygen atom in a ring.
They are heterocyclic compounds.
O O H2C CH2 H C CH 2 2 Epoxyethane H C CH 2 2 (Ethylene oxide) Tetrahydrofuran Tetrahydropyran (Oxalane) (Oxane) The three membered cyclic ethers are known as epoxides.
Unlike most ether, epoxides are very reactive substances.
Activity A/ Self Assessment Exercise i. Classify the following ethers as symmetrical and asymmetrical CH CH CH -O-CH CH CH , CH CH(CH )CH -O-CH CH , CH -O-CH CH 3 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 ii.
What are epoxides?
3.3 Naming Ethers and Epoxides Ethers can be named using the common system or the IUPAC system Commo n System: In the common system, ethers are named by prefixing the names of alkyl radicals attached to oxygen in alphabetical order before the name ether.
For example: CH -O-CH is known as dimethyl ether and CH -O-C H is simply ethyl 3 3 3 2 5 methyl ether (in alphabetical order).
IUPAC System: Using the IUPAC nomenclatures, ethers are named as alkoxy derivatives of alkanes.
The prefix−, OR’ is comp osed of the name of the simpler alky l g rou p in the molecule with the ‘–yl’ ending replaced by the ‘-oxy’.
The alkoxy prefix is then followed by the name of the corresponding alkane of the other alkyl group in the molecule.
For example: CH 3 | CH O- , CH CH O- , CH CH CHO , CH CO- , CH CHO- 3 3 2 3 2 3 3 | | | CH CH CH 3 3 3 Methoxy Ethoxy Sec-butoxy Isopropoxy Table 1:1 Structures, IUPAC and Common Names of Ethers STRUCTURE IUPAC COMMON NAMES CH OCH Methoxy methane Dimethyl ether 3 3 CH CH OCH Ethoxy ethane Diethyl ether 3 2 3 CH CH OCH Methoxy ethane Ethyl methyl ether 3 2 3 CH CH OCH CH CH Cl 1-Chloro-3-ethoxy propane 3-Chloropropyl ethyl ether 3 2 2 2 2 CH CHCH CH 2-Methoxy butane 2-Buthyl methyl ether 3 2 3 | OCH 3 36 Several cyclic ethers have specific IUPAC name.
For example Oxetane Oxane Oxalane (Tetrahydropyran) (Tetrahydrofuran) In each case the ring is numbered starting at the oxygen.
Tetrahydropyran and tetrahydrofuran are acceptable synonyms for oxane and oxalane repectively.
Some substances have more than one ether linkage, for example the diethers, 1,2- dimethoxyethane and 1,4-dioxane and the triether, diglyme.
CH OCH CH OCH CH OCH CH OCH CH OCH 3 2 2 3 3 2 2 2 2 3 1,2-Dimethoxy ethane Diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (Diglyme) 1,4-Dioxane Compounds that contain several ether functions are referred to as polyethers.

CH CH CHCH CH 3 2 2 3 | OC H 2 5 3.4 Isomerism Ethers exhibit the following types of structural isomerism 3.4.1 Functional group isomerism Ethers are isomeric with alcohols as both have the same general formula (C H O) but n 2n+2 different functional groups.
For example, methoxymethane (CH OCH ) and ethanol 3 3 (CH CH OH) have the same molecular formula, C H O.
3 2 2 6 37 3.4.2 Metamerism Ethers exhibit metamerism because of the difference in the size of the alkyl groups attached to the oxygen atom.
For example, the formula C H O represents three isomeric ethers or 4 10 metamers.
CH3 CH OCH CH CH C H OC H CH OCH 3 2 2 3 2 5 2 5 3 CH 3 Methoxy propane Ethoxy ethane 2-Methoxy propane 4.0 Conclusion Ethers are compounds having the general formula C H O. Epoxides are the three n 2n+2 membered cyclic ethers.

2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to: 1.
Discuss the various methods of preparing ethers in the laboratory and industrially 2.
Explain the various reactions of ethers 3.0 General Methods Of Preparation Ethers can be prepared from the following methods a. Dehydration of alcohols Simple or symmetrical ethers are obtained when excess alcohol is heated with concentrated tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid or tetraoxophosphoric(V) acid.
In the process, two molecules of alcohol lose a water molecule amongst themselves to form ethers.
ROH + HOR H SO R O R + H O 2 4 2 heat The method is employed industrially in the preparation of lower ethers.
Dehydration of primary alcohols may also be effected by passing alcohol vapour over heated catalysts like alumina at high pressure and temperature.
R O H + H O R Al O R O R + H O 2 3 2 250OC/Pressure When secondary and tertiary alcohols are used under these conditions, alkene is the main product.
b. Williamson Synthesis This method is the most important method for laboratory preparation of ethers.
It involves heating an alkyl halide with sodium or potassium alkoxides.
R O Na + R’X heat R O R’ + Nax Sodium alkyl ether alkoxide halide For example, C H ONa + C H Cl heat C H OC H + NaCl 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5 Sodium ethyl Ethoxyethane ethoxide chloride The reaction involves nucleophilic substitution of alkoxide ion for halide ion.
R’O + R−X R’O−R + X Nu substrate leaving group It is most suitable for preparing mixed or unsymmentrical ethers.
40 c. Heating Alkyl halides with dry silver oxide Ethers may be prepared by heating alkyl halides with dry silver oxide (Ag O).
2 2RX + Ag O heat R O R + 2AgX 2 For example: 2C H I + Ag O heat C H OC H + 2Ag I 2 5 2 2 5 2 5 2 Mixed ethers can be prepared by taking different alkyl halides in equimolar ratio.
2RX + Ag O + R’X heat R O R’ + 2AgX 2 CH I + Ag O + C H I heat CH OC H + 2Ag I 3 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 d. Reaction of lower halogenated ethers with Grignard reagents Higher homologues of ethers can be prepared by the action of Grignard reagent on lower halogenated ethers.

CH =CH + C H OH (i) Hg(OOCCF ) 2 2 2 5 3 2 (ii) NaBH 4 3.1 General Physical Properties i.
Lower members are gases while higher members are colourless, pleasant smelling, low boiling point, volatile liquids ii.
They are lighter than water iii.
They are sparingly soluble in water but readily soluble in organic solvents like benzene and chloroform.
Their solubility increases in the presence of alcohol probably, due to hydrogen bonding.
iv.
Ethers are also very important solvents in the laboratory v. Their boiling points, melting points and specific gravity increases with increase in molecular weight vi.
The boiling points of ethers are much lower than those of isomeric alcohols.
The higher boiling points of alcohols are due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding which is not possible in ethers vii.
Lower ethers acts as anesthetic and their vapour are highly inflammable viii.
Ethers are polar molecules and have definite dipole moments.
The value of dipole moment of ethoxy ethane is 1.12D.
The C-O-C valency angle in methoxy methane is 111o while that of ethoxy ethane is 118o 3.2 Chemical Properties Of Ethers Ethers are comparatively unreactive compounds.
The ether linkage is quite stable towards bases, oxidizing agents and reducing agents- they do not react with alkalis, with dilute acids, phosphoric halides etc in the cold.
This is because they lack the active hydrogen attached to oxygen as present in alcohol.
However, they show reactions due to the presence of: i. Alkyl radicals: They undergo substitution reactions as in the case of alkanes.
ii.
Ethereal oxygen: This coordinate with electron deficient molecules or Lewis acids.
iii.
Carbon-oxygen bond: It shows some cleavage reactions similar to carbon-carbon  42 cleavage.
However, the carbon-oxygen linkage is not as stable as the carbon-carbon linkage.
3.2.1 Reactions of the alkyl groups: Substitution Reaction i. Halogenation- Ethers undergo substitution at the alkyl radical when reacted with chlorine or bromine in the absence of sunlight.
They form halogen substituted ethers.
ROCH CH + Cl dark ROCHClCH + HCl 2 3 2 3 Usually the hydrogen of the α-carbon is substituted most readily.
For example: C H OC H + Cl dark C H OCHClCH Cl CH CHCl−O−CHClCH 2 5 2 5 2 2 5 3 2 3 3 -HCl α-monochloroethoxy -HCl α,α-dichloroethoxy ethene ethane In sunlight, all the hydrogen is substituted to form perhalo ethers.
For example, C H OC H + 10Cl light C Cl OC Cl + 10HCl 2 5 2 5 2 2 5 2 5 Perchloroethoxy Ethane ii.
Combustion: Ethers are volatile and highly inflammable.
They burn in air to form carbon(IV) oxide and water.
C H OC H + 4O 4CO + 5H O 2 5 2 5 2 2 2 3.2.2 Reactions of ethereal oxygen The oxygen atom in ether has two unshared lone pairs of electrons hence ether behaves like Lewis bases and coordinates with Lewis acids or substances deficient in electrons.
For example: i.
Formation of peroxides Peroxides are formed when ethers are taken through a prolonged action of atmospheric oxygen or ozonized oxygen due to co-ordination of one lone pair of electrons of the ethereal oxygen with another oxygen atom.
R – O − R’ + :O: R – O − R’ ↓ :O: For example: C H OC H + O (C H ) O→O 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 These peroxides are unstable compounds and decompose violently on heating.
ii.
Formation of oxonium salts Ethers react with strong mineral acids to form oxonium salts which are stable at low temperature in high concentration.
The oxonium salts when formed dissolved in solution.
43 + ROR’ + HX R − O − R’X | H Dialkyl oxonium halide R | _ ROR’ + H SO R – O+HSO 2 4 4 | H Dialkyl oxonium hydrogen tetraoxosulphate(VI) These salts however decompose to yield back ether and acid on dilution with water.
_ + C H OC H + HCl (C H ) OCl H O (C H ) O + HCl 2 5 2 5 2 5 2 2 2 5 2 | H Diethyl oxonium chloride They also form coordination complexes with Lewis acids like BF , AlCl , RMgX etc 3 3 R ROR’ + BF3 O→BF3 R’ Boron trifluoride etherate R OR 2 2R O + RMgX Mg 2 R O X 2 Ether complex of Grignard reagent This explains why they are used as solvent for Grignard reagents.
Activity A/Self Assessment Exercise Why are ethers useful as solvents in reactions involving the Grignard reagent 3.2.3 Reactions involving cleavage of carbon-oxygen bond i. Hydrolysis: When ethers are boiled with water or treated with steam, they are hydrolysed to form alcohols.
The rate of hydrolysis increases in the presence of dilute acid.
ii.
Action of tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid: When ethers react with hot tetraxoxsulphate (VI) acid, cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond occurs.
ROR’ + H SO (conc.)
heat ROH + R’HSO 2 4 4 For example: C H OC H + H SO (conc.)
heat C H OH + C H HSO 2 5 2 5 2 4 2 5 2 5 4 Ethanol ethyl hydrogentetraoxosulphate(VI)  44 iii.
Action of hydroboric or hydriodic acid: Ethers react with hydroboric or hydriodic acids in the cold to form an alcohol and alkyl halide.
When unsymmentrical ether is used, the halogen attaches itself to the smaller of the two alkyl groups of the ether.
ROR + 2HI Hot 2RI + H O C H OC H 2 2 5 2 5 + 2HI heat 2C H I + H O CH OC H 2 5 2 3 2 5 + 2HI heat CH I + C H I + H O 3 2 5 2 The order of reactivity of the acids is HI > HBr > HCl iv.
Action of Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl ): Ethers react with hot phosphorus 5 pentachloride, the reaction involve cleavage of carbon-oxygen bond to yield alkyl chlorides.
ROR’ + PCl RCl + R’Cl + POCl 5 3 C H OC H + PCl 2C H Cl + POCl 2 5 2 5 5 2 5 3 v. Action of acid derivatives: Ethers reacts with acid chlorides and acid anhydrides in the presence of catalyst like aluminium chloride or zinc chloride to form esters and alkyl halides.
ROR + R’COCl AlCl RCl + R’COOR 3 Ester For example: C H OC H + CH COCl AlCl C H Cl + CH COOC H 2 5 2 5 3 3 2 5 3 2 5 Acyl chloride Ethyl ethanoate C H OC H + (CH CO) O ZnCl CH COOC H 2 5 2 5 3 2 2 3 2 5 Ethanoic acid Anhydride Activity B/Self Assessment Exercise State the product(s) formed from the following reactions of propaoxy propane: i.

C H OC H + HI 3 7 3 7 iii.
C H OC H + PCl 3 7 3 7 5 3.2.4 Miscellaneous reactions Apart from the reactions discussed above, ethers also undergo the following reactions: i. Oxidation: Ethers are oxidized to form aldehydes or acids when treated with strong oxidising agents.
For example:  45 C H OC H K Cr O /Acid 2CH CHO O 2CH COOH 2 5 2 5 2 2 7 3 3 -H O Ethanal 2 ii.
Dehydration: Ethers undergo dehydration to form alkenes when ether vapour is passed over heated alumina.
C H OC H Al O 2CH =CH + H O 2 5 2 5 2 3 2 2 2 360O iii.
Reaction with alkyl metallics: Ethers do not normally react with bases but strong bases like alkali metal alkyls, e.g CH Na, convert them into alkene 3 and alkoxides.
_ + NaCH + H−CH CH −OC H CH + CH =CH + C H O-Na+ 3 2 2 2 5 4 2 2 2 5 Methyl ethane ethene sodium Sodium ethoxide iv.
Reaction with carbon monoxide: Under suitable conditions ethers react with carbon monoxide to form esters C H OC H + CO BF /150OC C H COOC H 2 5 2 5 3 2 5 2 5 500 atm.
4.0 Conclusion Ethers undergo reactions that involve the alkyl group, the ethereal oxygen and the reactions that involve the C-O cleavage.
Ethers also undergo reactions like oxidation, dehydration, reaction with alkyl methyl and reaction with carbon (II) oxide.

Esters are named as ‘alkyl alkanoate’.
The ‘alkyl’ is derived from the original alcohol while the ‘alkanoate’ is derived from the carboxylic acid.

Benzene- 1,4 –dioic acid 3.3 Structure of Carboxylic Acids In the structure of carboxylic acids, at the carbonyl linkage, there is a mesomeric withdrawal of electrons away from the carbon atom towards the more electronegative atom creating a relative positive charge on the carbon atom.
This deficiency of electrons about the carbon atom intensifies the inductive pull of electrons away from the hydrogen atom in the oxygen- hydrogen bond enhancing the stability of the carboxylate anion, RCOO, and promoting the release of a proton.
Oδ- δ+ R – C O H The carboxylate anion is a resonance hybrid, the π electrons being delocalize about the two carbon-oxygen bonds, making both bonds equivalent as shown below.
O O O −C −C ≡ −C O O O 3.4 Physical Properties All simple aliphatic carboxylic acids are liquids at room temperature.
They have a characteristic pungent smell and sour taste.
Aromatic acids are crystalline solids.
The boiling points of carboxylic acids increases with relative molecular mass and they are higher than those of the corresponding alkanes but lower than that of alcohols.
Aromatic acids have higher melting points than their aliphatic counterparts of comparative molecular mass.
The first four aliphatic acids are completely miscible with water due to the ability of the functional group to form hydrogen bonds with the water molecule.
However, the higher homologue becomes progressively less soluble in water because of their greater hydrocarbon.
Benzoic acid is only slightly soluble in cold water but dissolves reading in hot water.
All carboxylic acids can be dissolved in suitable organic solvents.
Generally, density of carboxylic acid decrease with increasing relative molecular mass.
Volatile aldehydes and ketones are flammable.
Simple ketones are less toxic than simple aldehydes.

E xplain the following reactions of carboxylic acids - Esterification - Halogenations iv.
Explain how esters are converted into: - Acyl chloride - Amide - Acid anhydrides v. Explain the reduction of carboxylic acids 3.0 Acidic Properties of Carboxylic Acids The acidic properties of carboxylic acids are due to their possessing ionizable hydrogen ions (H+), which results in the formation of carboxylates.
RCOOH + H O RCOO + H O+ K = 5 2 3 a Carboxylic acids are only partially ionized in aqueous solution owing to the predominantly covalent nature of the molecule, they are only very weak in comparison with the mineral acids.
They are however 1010 to 1011 times stronger in acidic strength than alcohols.
The comparative strengths of carboxylic acids are attributable to the stability of the carboxylic anion which is a resonance hybrid of two canonical forms, A and B below.
 O O O R – C R –C ≡ R − C O O O A B C The resonance energy assist the ionization process, hence the released of the proton.
The two canonical forms may be conveniently represented by the single structure C. The structure, C illustrates the equivalence of both carbon-oxygen bonds and also the equal distribution of the negative charge between the oxygen atoms.
This effect of charge dispersal results in the stabilization of the carboxylate ion, which enhances the dissociation of the acids.
The effect of charge of dispersal is more significant in benzoic acid and this enhances the stabilization of the carboxylate ion.
69 O O O O O O O O O O C C C C C | | ║ ║ | + + + Apart from resonance effect, the acidity of a carboxylic acid is affected by the substituent on its hydrocarbon chain.
The effect of the substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acids depends on whether the substituents are electron-donating or electron withdrawing.
When an electron-donating substituent (+I effect) is attached a carboxylic group, it intensifies the negative charge on the carboxylate ion hence destabilizing the anion making it difficult for the carboxylic acid to form the carboxyl ate and hydrogen ions.
On the contrary, when an electron withdrawing substituent (-I effect), is attached to a carboxylic group, it reduces the negative charge from the carboxylate ion (hence stabilizing the anion.
The higher the number of substituent with –I effect, the higher the acidity of the carboxylic acid.
The acidic strength decreases in the order.
Cl Cl CCOOH > HCOOH > C H COOH > CH COOH > CH CH COOH 6 5 3 3 2 Cl The distance between the substituent and the carboxylic group also has a significant effect on the acidity of carboxylic acid.
Activity A/Self Assessment Exercise i.
Arrange the following acids in an ascending order of acidity: CH COOH, CHCl COOH, CH Cl COOH, CCI COOH 3 2 2 2 3 3.1 Reactions due to Carboxyl Group As an acid, carboxylic acids undergo ionization into proton and the acid anion.
RCOOH RCOO + H+ 3.1.1 Salt Formation As an acid, carboxylic acids, irrespective of whether they are water soluble or not, liberate hydrogen in the presence of metals and carbon (iv) oxide when added to either sodiumtrioxocarbonate (iv) or hydrogentrioxocarbonate(iv) forming the metal carboxylate in all the reactions.
For example, RCOOH + 2Na 2RCOONa+ + H 2 Sodium Carboxylate 2RCOOH + Mg (RCOO) Mg2+ + H 2 2 Magnesium Carboxylate RCOOH + NaOH R COONa + H O 2 2RCOOH + Na CO 2RCOO Na+ + CO + H O 2 3 2 2 RCOOH + NaHCO RCOO Na+ + CO + H O 3 2 2 70 The carboxylic acid can be generated by treating the salt with dilute mineral acid.

3.2.1 Esterification Esters are formed when carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of concentrated tetraoxosulphate (vi) acid as a catalyst.
O O ConcH SO ║ 2 4 2R – C + R’OH R – C – OR’ + H O 2 O This reaction is slow and reversible and the yield of ester is often low.
Esters are also formed when carboxylic acids react with sulphur dichloride oxide followed by an alcohol.
SOCl R’OH 2 RCOOH RCOCl RCOOR’ + HCl The yield of ester with sulphur dichloride is good.
3.2.2 Formation of Acyl Chlorides Acyl chlorides can be made by reacting carboxylic acids with reagents like phosphorus trichloride, PCl , phosphorus pentachloride, PCl or sulphur dichloride oxide(thionyl 3 5 chloride), SOCl .
For example, 2 RCOOH + PCl RCOCl + H PO 3 3 3 RCOOH + PCl RCOCl + POCl + HCl 5 3 RCOOH + SOCl RCOCl + HCl + SO 2 3 These reactions are examples of substitution reaction.
Sulphur dichloride oxide is particularly convenient of all the reagents because all the products are gaseous except acyl chloride.
Also, sulphur dichloride oxide has a low boiling point of 79oC making it easy for the separation of the acyl chloride from excess sulphur dichloride oxide.
The acyl chloride can be hydrolyzed easily in the presence of water to regenerate the carboxylic acids.

The hydroxyl group can be replaced by –Cl, -COCR, -NH or -OR’ groups giving the compounds known as 2 acyl chloride (acid chloride), acid anhydrides, amides and esters respectively.
They can be represented by the general formula O ║ R C Z Where Z represents Cl, OCOR’, NH or OR’ 2 R and R’ may be alkyl or aryl.
O The R – C group, common to all the derivatives is called the acyl group 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: i.
Identify the structures of the various derivatives of carboxylic acids ii.

Explain the reaction of acyl chloride, acid anhydrides, amides and esters 3.0 General Comparative Properties Chlorides, anhydrides and esters have normal boiling points and are similar in value to those of aldehydes and ketones of comparative relative molecular mass.
Amides have a higher than expected boiling points and at normal temperatures, they exist as solid because of a fairly high degree of intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
The ability of amides to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules allows them to be much more soluble than other derivatives.
Simple chlorides and anhydrides undergo spontaneous hydrolysis in water.
3.1 Reactivity The derivatives of carboxylic acids undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions.
This is characterized by nucleophilic substitutions of the halogen, carboxylate, alkoxy or amino groups and the reaction is similar to the condensation reactions of aldehydes and ketones.
All the substituent groups possess lone pairs of electrons which are conjugated with the carbonyl group.
As the electronegativity of the group increases, the degree of conjugation decreases and the electron availability about the carbonyl oxygen is reduced.
O O ║ ║ R−C−Z + Nu R−C−Nu + Z The order of electronegativity of the substituent group is as follows − Cl > OOCR’ > OR’ > −NH 2  77 The overall polarity of the carbonyl group is enhanced by the more electronegative substituent due to the simultaneous withdrawal of electron away from the carbon atom, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.
The decreasing order of reactivity of carboxylic acid itself and its derivatives are as follow: O O − C O O O −C > O > − C > −C > −C Cl −C OH OR’ NH 2 O Activity A/Self Assessment Exercise Arrange the following in increasing order of reactivity: CH COOH, CH COOC H , CH COCl, CH CONH , (CH CO) O 3 3 2 5 3 3 2 3 2 3.2 Acyl Chlorides(Acid Chlorides) 3.2.1 General Methods of Formation a.

They fume in moist air producing vapours of hydrogen chloride iv.
They are generally insoluble.
However they hydrolyse slowly to go into solution.
3.2.3 Reactions of Acyl chlorides The reactions of acyl chlorides are fundamentally similar to those of carboxylic acids.
The halogen readily undergoes nucleophilic substitution by – OH – OR’, NH etc.
The 2 mechanism is similar to those of the condensation reactions of aldehydes and ketones.
78 Benzoyl chloride is much less reactive than any aliphatic acyl chloride due to the reduction in the positive nature of the carbonyl carbon caused by delocalization of electrons between it and the benzene ring (resonance effect), leading to reduction in the strength of the electron deficient nucleophilic site .

RC ≡ N + H2O RCONH2 3.5.2 Physical Properties i.
Primary amides, RCONH are crystalline solids due to mainly fairly strong 2 intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
However methanamide is a liquid at room temperature (melting point 3OC).
ii.
The melting points of the amides are high for the size of the molecules because they can form hydrogen bonds.
The hydrogen atoms in the NH group are sufficiently 2 positive to form a hydrogen bond with a lone pair on the oxygen atom of another molecule.
O CH −C 3 N−H | H Hydrogen Bond O CH − C 3 N−H | H Each molecule has two slightly positive hydrogen atoms hence there is the potential for lots of hydrogen bonds to be formed.
These hydrogen bonds need a reasonable amount of energy to break, and so the melting points of the amides are quite high.
87 iii.
The small chain amides are soluble in water because they have the ability to form hydrogen bond with the water molecules.
3.5.3 Reactions of amides Amides are slightly basic in character, because of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom.
Owing to resonance between the two canonical forms of amide, the lone pair of electrons are not readily available for donation as in amines making amides much less basic.
a. Hydrolysis of amides Hydrolysis of amide is either acid catalyzed or alkaline catalyzed.
The acid hydrolysis involves the use of acids such as dilute hydrochloric acid which acts as a catalyst for the reaction between the amide and water.

OH RCONH2 RCOO + NH3 heat For example, CH CONH + NaOH CH COONa + NH 3 2 3 3 The acid catalysed hydrolysis gives carboxylic acids and ammonium salt, while the base catalyzed hydrolysis gives carboxylate and ammonia gas.
b. Hofmann Degradation The Hofmann degradation is a reaction between an amide and a mixture of bromine and sodium hydroxide solution in the presence of heat.
The overall effect of the reaction is a loss of the carboxyl group of the amide to get a primary amine the original amide.
RCONH + Br + 4NaOH RNH + 2NaBr + Na CO + 2H O 2 2 2 2 3 2 For example, CH CONH + Br + 4NaOH CH NH + Na CO + 2NaBr + 2H O 3 2 3 2 2 3 2 The Hoffmann degradation is used as a way of removing carbon atom out of a chain.
c. Dehydration Amides are dehydrated by heating a solid mixture of the amide and phosphorus (v) oxides, P O .
Water is removed from the amide group to leave a nitrile group, CN.
The liquid nitrile 2 5 is collected by simple distillation.

Compare the physical properties of the carbonyl compounds 4.0 Structures of Aldehyde and Ketones In aldehydes, the carbonyl group has a hydrogen atom attached to it together with either a second hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group which might be an alkyl group or one containing a benzene ring.
For example: O O O H− C CH −C CH − CH − CH− C 3 3 2 H H | H H Methanol Ethanal 2-Methylbutanal O −C H benzaldehyde All the structures above have exactly the same end to the molecule; all that differs is the complexity of the other group attached.
In ketones the carbonyl group has two hydrocarbon groups attached.
These could either be alkyl group or one containing alkyl group and one aromatic ring or two aromatic rings.
For example: O O O CH − C CH − C CH − CH −C 3 3 3 2 CH CH −CH CH −CH 3 2 3 2 3 Propanone (Acetone) Butanone Pentan-3-one  97 O O ║ CH3− C C Phenyl ethanone Diphenyl ketone (benzophenone) 3.1 IUPAC Nomenclature of Aldehydes and Ketones 3.1.1 Aldehydes The names of Aldehydes are derived from the root hydrocarbon by adding the suffix ‘-al’ to replace ‘-e’ from the corresponding alkane.
For example, H O C=O CH3− C H H Methanal Ethanal Where there are other substituents on the carbon chain, they are named using prefix (es) with the numbering of carbon from the carbonyl carbon.
For example: OH H | | O O H− C − C− C CH − C 2 | | H | H H H 3-hydroxylpropanal Phenylethanal 3.1.2 Ketones Ketones are named as derivatives of the corresponding alkane with the suffix ‘-one’ replacing the ‘-e’ from the corresponding alkane.
For example, O O .
CH − C CH CH − C 3 3 2 CH CH 3 3 Propanone butanone  98 O O .
CH3− C CH3CH2− C CH CH 3 3 Pentan -3-one Pentan-2-one O C CH3 Phenylethanone The position of the carbonyl group on the carbon chain for isomeric ketones is indicated with numbers, for example Pentan-3-one Activity A/ Self Assessment Exercise a.

Draw the structures of the following carbonyl compound i.
3-methyl butanal ii.
Benzaldehyde iii.
3-methyl-2-butanone 3.2 Bonding and reactivity The carbon- oxygen double bond is very highly polar.
This is because oxygen is far more electronegative than carbon and so has a strong tendency to pull electrons in a carbon-oxygen bond towards itself making it partially negative and the carbon partially positive.
∂+ ∂- C O 3.3 Physical properties Simple aliphatic aldehydes and ketones are all colourless liquid at 20oC with the exception of methanal which is a gas (boiling point-21oC).
Ethanal has a boiling point of 20oC, which means, it boils at close to room temperature.
The boiling points increase as the molecules get bigger.
The size of the boiling point is governed by the strength of the Van der Waal’s force of attraction which becomes stronger as the molecules get longer and have more electrons.
This  99 explains why the boiling point increases as the number of carbon atoms in the chain increases.
The functional group C=O is polar due to a significant difference in electronegativities of the carbon oxygen atoms.
Because of the high polarity in their molecules, carbonyl compounds have higher boiling points than alkanes of similar molecular masses, but much lower than those of alcohols of similar molecular masses because carbonyl compounds unlike alcohols do not have intermolecular hydrogen bonding.
Table 1.1 Boiling Point of Propane, Ethanal and Ethanol Molecule Type Boiling Point(oC) CH CH CH alkane -42 3 2 3 CH CHO aldehyde -21 3 CH CH OH alcohol 78 3 2 Notice that in table 1.1 above, the aldehyde (with dipo le-dipole attractions as well as Van der Waals forces) has a boiling point higher than the similarly size alkane which only has forces of attraction.
The density of simple aldehydes and ketones are lower than that of water and increases as the relative molecular mass increases.
Aromatic aldehydes and ketones are slightly denser than water.
Aldehydes and ketones with short hydrocarbon chains are miscible with water while those with long hydrocarbon chains are insoluble.
Lower members of carbonyl compounds can form hydrogen bonds with water molecule and so they have reasonably high solubility in water compared with hydrocarbons of similar molecular masses.
Carbonyl compound with carbon atoms of five and above and aromatic compounds which occurs in nature are insoluble in water since the hydrophobic character of the alkyl chains and aromatic rings outweighs the polar character of the carbonyl group.

Conclusion Aldehydes and ketones are known as carbonyl compounds.
The names of Aldehydes are derived from the root hydrocarbon by adding the suffix “al” to replace “e” from the corresponding alkane while ketones are named as derivatives of the corresponding alkane with the suffix “-one” replacing the “-e” from the corresponding alkane.

Prepare aldehydes and ketones from Friedel Craft acylation reaction 3.0 Preparation of Aldehydes and ketones Aldehydes and ketones can be prepared using the various methods discussed below: 3.1 Oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols Aldehydes and ketones are prepared by the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols respectively using a mild oxidizing agent such as acidified solution of potassium heptadicromate (VI) or tetraoxomanganate (VII) H O R − C − OH K Cr O / H+ R − C − H + H O 2 2 7 2 [O] reflux H H R΄ R − C − OH K Cr O / H+ C O + H 2 2 7 2 [O] reflux H R For example: O CH CH OH K Cr O / H+ CH3 − C 3 2 2 2 7 Reflux H 3CH3CH2OH + Cr2O 72- + 8H+ 3CH3CHO + 2Cr3+ + 7H2O H O 3CH − C − O-H + Cr O 2- + 8H+ 3CH C + 2Cr3+ + 7H O 3 2 7 3 2 CH CH 3 3  103 When potassium heptaoxodichromate (VI) acidified with dilute tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid is used, a change in the colour of the solution from the orange solution containing the dichromate (VI) ions is reduced to a green solution containing chromium (III) ions.
The net effects is that an oxygen from the oxidizing agent removes one hydrogen atom from the - OH group of the alcohol and another one from the carbon to which it is attached to form water.
However in the oxidation of primary alcohols to form aldehydes, there is a problem.
The aldehydes produced can be oxidized further to a carboxylic acid by the acidified dichromate (VI) solution used as the oxidizing agent.
This however can be prevented by using excess alcohol and limited oxidizing agent.
Also by removing the aldehydes as soon as it is formed, it can be controlled.
3.2 Oxidative cleavage of alkanes (ozonolysis) Ozone, when bubbled through a solution of an alkene in 1, 1, 1- trichloromethane, followed by the hydrolysis of the ozonide formed, in the presence of zinc and ethanoic acid gives aldehydes and ketones.
The starting alkene determines the product, if aldehydes or ketones.

This is due to the difference in electronegative between carbon and oxygen atom.
The carbonyl carbon atom is the nucleophilic site since it is electron deficient because of the difference in electronegativity between carbon and oxygen.
H+ + C=O C-OH Nu 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit, you should be able to: i.
Discuss the various reactions of aldehydes and ketones under the following endings - Nucleophilic addition reaction - Condensation reaction ii.
Distinguish between aldehydes and ketones using: - Fehling’s reaction - Schiff reagent -Silver mirror test 3.0 The Carbonyl Carbon has a nucleophilic site The susceptibility of the carbonyl carbon to nucleophilic attack is reduced by its attachment to electron releasing alkyl or aryl groups, which reduces the degree of positive charge on the carbon.
Also, the increase in steric hindrance about the carbon by the bulky hydrocarbon groups hinders the approach of the attacking nucleophile and contributes to the reduction in this reactivity.
Hence, aldehydes are more reactive than ketones because they contain only one hydrocarbon group.
The carbonyl carbon in the aldehydes is more positive and less sterically hindered than that in ketones, hence more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.
The order of reactivity of carbonyl compounds to nucleophilic attack is as follows.
H R R C=O > C=O > C=O H H R Ar Ar Ar C=O > C=O > C=O H R Ar Alkyl groups donate electrons by inductive effects while aryl (Ar) groups do so by the resonance.

For example, CH CH MgBr.

This reaction is very useful for preparation all three classes of alcohols.

The carbonyl hydrogensulphite is treated with an acid or an alkali to regenerate the free carbonyl compound.
This reaction is a very good method for the purification and seperation of suitable carbonyl compounds from non carbonyl compounds.
The hydrogenosulphate reacts with potassium cyanide or sodium cyanide to give a 2 - hydroxyalkanonitrile.

Explain Claisen condensation and Cross claisen condensation 3.0 Acidity Of α – Hydrogen In carbonyl compounds, the α- hydrogen is the hydrogen attached to the carbon atom bearing the carbonyl group.
In the study of aldehydes and ketones, the carbonyl group largely determines the chemistry by providing a site at which nucleophilic addition can take place.
However one other important role of the carbonyl group not as a functional group but as a substituent is its ability to strengthen the acidity of the hydrogen atoms attached to the α – carbon and by doing this, gives rise to a whole set of chemical reactions.
When the α-hydrogen is ionized it yields a carbanion (I) which is resonance hybrid of two structures.
| | −C−C− + :B −C−C− + B: H | ║ − | I The carbanion is a resonance hybrid of two structures II and III.
| | | −C−C− ≡ −C−C− −C=C− − |  ║ | O O  II III These resonance structures are only possible through the participation by the carbonyl group.
Resonance of this kind is not possible for carbanions formed by ionization of β-hydrogens, γ- hydrogen, etc.

The carbonyl group affects the acidity of α-hydrogens by helping to accommodate the negative change of the anion that develops as a result of attacks.

The carbanions are highly basic and exceedingly reactive particles.
In their reactions they behave as nucleophiles.
As nucleophiles, they attack carbon and in so doing form carbon-carbon bonds.
The following are some reactions involving carbanions.
3.1.1.

Nucleophilic addition to carbonyl compounds a. Aldol condensation Under the influence of dilute base or dilute acid, two molecules of an aldelyde or a ketone may combine to form a β-hydroxy aldehyde or β-hydroxy ketone.
This reaction is called the Aldo l condensation.
| | | | | C + −C –C = O base or acid −C –C –C =O ║ | | O H OH An aldol (α, β-hydroxyl carbonyl compound) The product formed results from the addition of one molecule of aldehyde (or ketone) to a second molecule in such a way that the α-carbon of the first becomes attached to the carbonyl carbon of the second.
For example: H H H H H H | | | | | | CH – C = O + H –C –C = O OH CH –C – C –C =O 3 3 | | | H OH H If the aldehyde or ketone does not contain an α-hydrogen, a simple Aldol condensation cannot take place.
Mechanism The hydroxide ion donates a lone pair to one of the α-hydrogen to form a water molecule and a carbanion, the later functioning as a nucleophile towards the unionized carbonyl molecule.

Nucleophilic Acyl substitution a. Claisen condensation.
Formation of β-Keto esters.
An α-hydrogen in an ester, like an α hydrogen in an aldehyde or ketone is weakly acidic and for the same reason, through resonance, the carbonyl group helps accommodate the negative charge of the carbanion.
Claisen condensation involves nucleophilic attack by a carbanion on an election deficient carbonyl carbon.
It is for esters and it is the exact counterpart of the Aldol condensation.
In aldol condensation, nucleophilic attack leads to addition, the typical reaction of aldehydes and ketones while in Claisen condensation, nucleophilic attack leads to substitution, the typical reaction of acyl compounds.
The preparation of ethyl acetoacetate- a β-keto acid illustrates the reaction known as the Claisen condensation.
When ethyl acetate is treated with sodium ethoxide and the resulting mixture is acidified, there is obtained ethyl-β- ketobutyrate(ethyl 3-oxobutanoate), generally known as ethyl acetoacetate or acetoacetic ester.

The carbonyl group of α,β – unsaturated aldehydes and ketones consists of a nucleophilic oxygen and an electrophilic carbon.
However, they also have another electrophilic carbon- the β-carbon.
O O | ║ | ║ − C – C = C – C – H − C– C = C – C – CH 3 | β α | β α α,β – unsaturated aldehyde α,β – unsaturated ketone 3.1 Preparation There are several ways to make α,β – unsaturated compounds: aldol condensation for unsaturated aldehydes and ketones; dehydrohalogenation of α – halo acid and the Perkin condensation for unsaturated acids.
3.2 Interaction of Functional group The carbon – carbon double bond normally serve as a source of electrons for the electrophilic reagent.
However, the availability of its electrons is determined by the groups attached to it.
An electron- releasing substituents stabilizes the transition state leading to the initial carbocation by dispersing the developing positive charge while an electron withdrawing substituents destabilizes the transition state by intensifying the positive charge.
C = O, -COOH, -COOR and –CN groups are powerful electron withdrawing groups and therefore would be expected to deactivate a carbon-carbon double bond toward electrophilic addition.
For this reason, α,β – unsaturated ketones, acids ethers are nitriles are generally less reactive than simple alkenes towards reagents like bromine and the hydrogen halides.
135 However, these powerful electron withdrawing substituents at the same time activate the carbon-carbon double bond towards electron-rich reagents, hence why α,β – unsaturated ketones , acid, ester and nitriles are susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

However, α,β – unsaturated aldehydes and ketones also have another electrophilic carbon – the β – carbon.
This is due to the influence of the electronegative oxygen which results in the resonance shown below.
O O  ║ | H C – C = C – C H C− C – C = C 3 3 \ + \ H H I II There are therefore two electrophilic centres.
Since there are two electrophilic points, there are also two nucleophilic points.
If the nucleophile reacts with the carbonyl carbon, this is a normal nucleophilic addition to aldehydes or ketones and it is called 1,2-nucleophilic addition.
However, if the nucleophile add to the β – carbon, then it is a 1,4 – nucleophilic addition or a conjugate addition.
3.3.1Electrophilic addition The presence of the carbonyl group lowers the reactivity of the carbon-carbon double bond towards electrophilic addition as well as controlling the orientation of addition.
Generally the addition of an unsymmetrical reagent to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound takes in such a way that hydrogen becomes attached to the α-carbon and the negative group becomes attached to the β-carbon.
For example: β α CH = CH – CHO + HX CH − CH – CHO 2 2 | | X H β – Halopropanal For example: CH =CH–CHO + HCl -10oC CH – CH − CHO 2 | | Cl H  136 CH =CH–COOH + H O H SO , 100OC CH –CH−COOH 2 2 2 4 2 | | OH H Addition to α,β- unsaturated carbonyl compounds take place in such a way as to form the most stable intermediate carbocation.

Of the two positions, the addition at the carbonyl oxygen gives the more stable cation (I).
In cation I, the positive charge is carried by the carbon atoms alone and not partly by the more highly electronegative oxygen atom.
The second step of the reaction involves the addition of a negative ion or basic molecule either to the carbonyl carbon or to the β-carbon of the hybrid ion I giving rise to two possibilities- structures III and IV.
The addition to the β-carbon is the one that yields a stable product (III) which is the enol form of the saturated carbonyl compound.
This will then undergo tautomerization to the keto form to give the observed product (V).

The Diels-Alder reaction This is the reaction between α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with conjugated dienes.

The Diels-Alder reaction is the most important example of cycloaddition.
It is known as a[4 + 2] cycloaddition since it involves a system of four π electrons (the diene) and a system of two π electrons(the dienophile).
The Diels-Alder reaction is very useful because it generates a ring and also because it takes place readily for a wide variety of reactants.
The reaction is favoured by the electron withdrawing substituents in the dienophile.

The most commonly encountered heterocyclic compounds contains only nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur as hetero atom 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to: i.
Define heterocyclic compounds ii.
List classes of heterocyclic compounds iii.
Give examples of five membered, six-membered and condensed heterocyclic compound iv.
Name simple heterocyclic compounds 3.0 Occurrences of Heterocyclic Compounds Heterocyclic compounds have been found to be highly reactive.
Heterocyclic intermediates have been used more and more in synthesis as protecting groups.
In the biological world,they are everywhere, for example, chlorophyll which makes leaves green in plants and heme which is responsible for making blood red in animals are important heterocyclic compounds.
Some heterocyclic rings are however not considered as heterocyclic compounds due to the relatively instability of their ring systems and lack of aromatic character.
For example, epoxides and γ- or δ lactones.
The introduction of hetero atom in the ring in place of carbon does not alter the strain relationship significantly.
The most stable heterocyclic compounds are those having five or six membered rings.
Heterocyclic compounds are thus defined as those compounds having five or six membered ring, with at least one hetero atom as the ring member, which are relatively stable and exhibit aromatic character.
3.1 Classification Heterocyclic compounds may be classified into three main categories: 3.1.1 Five membered heterocyclics They are considered as being derived from benzene by replacing a C=C by a hetero atom with an unshared electron pair.
The five membered ring can be further divided into a.
Compounds having only one hetero atom.
For example, furan, thiophene and pyrrole containg O, S, and N respectively as hetero atoms.
O S :NH •• •• Furan(Oxole) Thiophene(Thiole) Pyrrole(Azole) b.
Compounds having more than one hetero atom  146 The two hetero atoms may be same, as in pyrazole and imidazone or different, as in thiazole and oxazole.

They may be divided into two types: a.
Compounds with one hetero atoms For example, pyridine, pyran, thiopyranetc b.
Compounds with more than one hetero atom For example, pyrimidine, pyrazine, pyridazine etc N N N N S N N Pyridine γ-Pyran γ-Thiopyran Pyridazine Pyrimidine Pyrazine (Azine) (4H-Oxane) (4H-Thiane) (1,2-Diazine) (1,3-Diazine) (1,4-Diazine) + Pyrilium ion 3.1.3 Condensed heterocyclics They may consist of two or more fused rings which may be partly carbocyclic and partly heterocyclic, e.g indole, quinoline, carbazole or may be completely heterocyclic eig purine, pteridine etc.
They may be classified into two classes based on their properties.
147 a. Heteroparaffins They ressemble paraffin.
E.g tetrahydrofuran(THF) , pyrrolidine, piperidine etc b. Hetero aromatics They resemble aromatic compounds.
E.g pyrrole, thiophene, furan, pyridine, indole etc.
NH NH Tetrahydrofuran Pyrrolidine Piperidine Tetrahydropyrane THF(Oxalane) (Azolidine) (Perhydroazine) (Oxane) 3.2 Naming Heterocyclic Compound Heterocyclic compounds are generally known by their common names.
The IUPAC system has accepted most of the common names.
However, the IUPAC system of naming is still utilized.
The IUPAC name of heterocyclic is obtained by combining the following prefixes and suffixes in Table 1.1 Order of seniority Prefixes Suffixex 1 oxa for oxygen -ole 5-membered ring 2 thia for sulphur -ine 6-membered ring 3 aza for nitrogen -epine 7-membered ring 4 phospha for phosphorus bora for 5 boron Table 1.1 (Source:A Textbook of Organic Chemistry,3rd Edition-By K.S Tewari and N.K.Vishnoi) The terminal ‘a’ of the prefixes is usually dropped when combing prefixes and suffixes.
See the table below: No of atoms Rings containing nitrogens Rings containing nitrogen forming ring Unsaturated Saturated Unsaturated Saturated 3 irine Iridine Irene irane 4 ete etidine Ete etane 5 ole olidine Ole olane 6 ine perhydro In ane Azine Table 1.2-Suffix used in naming heterocyclic rings (Source:A Textbook of Organic Chemistry,3rd Edition-By K.S Tewari and N.K.Vishnoi)  148 If more than one hetero atom is present, the prefixes are placed in order of seniority.
i.e ‘oxa-’ first then ‘thia-’, etc.
The simple heterocyclics containing one atom are numbered in such a way that the hetero atom gets the lowest possible numbers and the numbering is continued in anti-clockwise direction.
The ring positions are designated by numeral or Greek letters.
When Greek letters are used, the position next to the hetero atom is designated as α- followed by β- and so 0n.
For example, 4γ 5 4 β’ β β’ β β’ β 4 3 4 3 5 3 6 3 α’ α α α α’ α 5 2 5 2 6 2 NH N 7 N 2 1 1 1 8 1 However, in some condensed heterocyclics, the number given to the hetero atom depends on the type of compound.
For example, in isoquinoline, ‘N’ does not get the lowest possible number.
5 4 6 3 N 7 2 8 1 When two or more hetero atoms are present, the numbering is done in such a manner that the hetero atom higher in seniority gets the lowest number .
For example ‘O’ takes precedence over ‘S’, and ‘S’ over ‘N’ and the other hetero atoms get the next number.

During the fractional distillation of coal tar, thiophene(b.pt 83oC) is collected along with the benzene(b.pt 80oC) hence ordinary benzene always contains about 0.5% of thiophene which must be treated if thiophene free benzene is desired.
Thiophene is also present in shale oil and pyrrole in bone oil.
Furan is present in the distillate of pine-wood.
The pyrrole ring system occurs in a large number of naturally occurring substances.
E.g chlorophyll, haemin,cyanocobalamin(Vitamin B12), auxins, alkaloids etc 3.1 Naming Five Membered Heterocyclics The nomenclature has been discussed earlier (Unit 1).
The ring atoms are numbered such that the hetero atom is given the lowest number or when using the Greek numbering,the carbon atom next to the hetero atom is designated as α- while the next to them is β-carbon atom.
The radicals thienyl-, furyl- and pyrryl- are derived from thiophene, furan and pyrrole respectively by replacing one hydrogen atom.
The position of the hydrogen replaced is indicated by the number of carbon atom, e.g 2-thienyl-, or 3-thienyl- etc.

They are colourless liquids ii.
The boiling point of furan, thiophene and pyrrole are 32OC, 84OC and 129oC respectively.
The relatively high boiling point of pyrrole is due to associated intermolecular H-bonding.
3.3.2 Aromatic Character Like benzene they exhibit aromatic characters and are resonance stabilized.
Their resonance energies are however lower than that of benzene and decrease in the order thiophene > pyrrole > furan.
However, unlike benzene, the dipolar structures are important contributing structures to stability.
  _ _ Z Z Z Z Z •• + + + + (Z = O, S, or –NH) Resonance stabilized heterocyclic compounds Each of the ring atoms is in sp2 hybridization state and the ring is planar.
A to tal of six π electrons consisting of two π and one lone pair are available for delocalization and hence they exhibit aromatic characters.
Because of their aromatic characters, they are resistant to addition reactions like hydrogenation.
Their important reactions are electrophilic substitution reactions at carbon.
154 3.3.3 Reactivity Their electrophilic substitution reactions can be most closely compared to those of phenols.
:OH +OH OH | ║ H | E E+ E -H •• Z Z E Z E H E+ -H+ Their reactivity towards electrophiles shows that they are more reactive than benzene.
For example, thiophene is 1000times more reactive than benzene.
The increasing order of reactivity is: Benzene < Thiophene < Furan < Pyrrole.
Furan is less reactive than pyrrole because oxygen accommodates a positive charge less readily than nitrogen.
Thiophene is less reactive than Furan because the +M effect of sulphur is smaller than that of oxygen.
Because of the greater reactivity of these rings systems, they can undergo substitution reactions under milder conditions The electrophilic substitution occur either at α- or β- position.
However, due to a greater stabilization of the intermediate carbocation formed during α- substitution compared to the intermediate carbocation formed in the β- substitution, the former position is preferred.

For example, electron donating groups increase the reactivity to such an extent that the resultant compounds are highly unstable.
Example of electron donating groups are –NH , -NR , -OH, -OR.
2 2 155 Electron withdrawing groups such as –NO , -SO H, -COOR etc decrease the reactivity and 2 3 stabilizes the ring by increasing resonance with the hetero atom.
Even with electron withdrawing group attached, the incoming substituent enters only 2 or 5 position.

3.4 Individual Members-Thiophene, Furan, Pyrrole We are now going to take a closer look at the reactions of the individual members of the five membered heterocyclics 3.4.1 Thiophene a.
Physical Properties: It is a colourless liquid with a boiling point of 85oC.
It is insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents.
b.
Chemical Properties: Thiophene resembles benzene in most of its chemical reactions.
This may be because they have similar molecular mass, similar shapes of molecules and especially similar electronic structures.

H v. O 4 9 3 3 3 2 2 3.4.3 Pyrrole Structure Its molecular formula is C H N. It is the nitrogen analogue of furan and thiophene .
It 4 5 resembles furan and thiophene and its synthesis from succinic acid points to the cyclic structure of furan.
The aromatic nature of pyrrole as shown in its resistance to additions and ease of electrophilic substitutions is explained in terms of either resonance or molecular orbital concept Resonace Concept: It is a resonace hybrid of the following structures:   NH NH NH NH NH •• •• •• •• •• I Resonance stabilized pyrrole anion OR NH II  162 Its resonance energy is 21kcal/mol.
The double bond shown in its classical structure (I) are not true double bonds, hence it is expected to be resistance to addition reaction.
Also the non-availability of the lone pair of electrons at nitrogen explains the lack of basic character.
Molecular orbital Concept: All the carbon and nitrogen atoms in pyrrole are in sp2 hybridization state and form σ bonds with three other atoms by overlap of trigonal sp2 hybrid orbitals.
Thus all the C and N lie in the same plane at an angle of 120oC to each other.
At each of the carbon there is one unhybridized p-orbital carrying one electron while the unhybridized p-orbital of the nitrogen atom carries the lone pair of electrons.
The p-orbitals are at right angles to the plane of the ring atoms and they overlap with each o ther to form a d elocalised π- molecular orbital electron cloud above and below the plane.
This cloud contains six electrons required for aromaticity and thus explains the stability of pyrrole to addition reaction and its tendency to undergo substitution reaction.
The non-availability of the lone pair of electron of the nitrogen because of its involvement in the π electron cloud, explains the weak basic character of pyrrole.
Properties of Pyrrole a.
Physical Properties: It is a colourless liquid with a boiling point of 131oC.
It is sparingly soluble in water but fairly soluble in ethanol and ether.
It darkens when exposed to air.
b.
Chemical Properties: Pyrrole differs markedly in chemical properties from thiophene and furan.
However it undergoes usual electrophilic substitution reactions.
It has amphoteric properties and behaves like very weak base due to withdrawal of electron density from nitrogen by aromatic sextet and as a weak acid due to greater stabilization by pyrrole.
i. Hydrogenation: Pyrrole on reduction with zinc and acetic acid forms pyrroline(2,5- dihydropyrrole), which on heating with hydriodic acid and red phosphorus yields pyrrolide(tetrahydropyrrole).
H /Ni Zn/CH COOH HI/P 2 3 200oC NH NH NH NH ii.
Basic Character: It is a very weak secondary base and dissolves slowly in dilute acids.
This is due to the withdrawal of the lone pair of electrons from nitrogen towards aromatic sextet making it available for protonation with acids.
iii.
Acidic Character: Pyrrole is weakly acidic in nature unlike furan and thiophenes.
It thus reacts with metallic potassium or potassium hydroxide to form pot assium salt which can be hydrolysed back to pyrrole on treatment with water.
The acidic character of pyrrole is due to two reasons: - The relatively easy dissociation of proton attached to N  163 - The greater stability of the pyrrole anion as compared to pyrrole KOH -H O 2 NH N K+ •• •• Potassiopyrrole   NH NH NH NH NH •• •• •• •• •• Resonance stabilized pyrrole anion iv.
Electrophilic Substitution reactions Pyrrole is highly reactive towards electrophilic substitution reactions.

It is a stronger base b b than pyrrole (pk = 13.6) but much weak than aliphatic tertiary amines (pkb = 4).

Electrophilic substitution reactions Pyridine behaves as a highly deactivated aromatic nucleus towards electrophilic substitution reaction and vigorous reaction conditions must be employed for these reactions to occur.
This low reactively towards electrohilic substitution by pyridine is due to two reasons: - because of the great electronegativly of nitrogen atom ,it decreases electron atom density of the ring (-I effect), hence deactivating the ring.
- In acidic medium, it forms a pyridine caption with a positive charge at way atom and this nitrogen decreases the election density much move effectively – thus deactivating the ring.
The position -3 is however the least effective and is comparatively the position of highest electron density in pyridine.

Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions Due to decrease of electron density on ring carbon atoms, pyridine is rendered susceptible to nucleophilic attack.
The nucleophilic substitution occur readily at the 2 and 4 positions since these positions are much more electron deficient than position 3.
The pyridinium ion is more reactive than pyridine toward nucleophilic substitution owing to the presence of full positive change.

It is basic in nature and forms quaternary salts with one mole of acid e.g.
C H N + HCl C H NHCl 5 5 5 5 Pyridine hydrochloride ii.
Its neutralization equivalent shows it is a monoacid iii.
It does not react with acetyl chloride or HNO showing the absence of primary 3 or secondary nitrogen or amino group.
iv.
It reacts with one mole of methyl iodide to form a quaternary ammonium salt N-methylpyridinium iodide.
_ + C H N + CH I C H NCH I 5 5 3 5 5 3 c. The carbon skeleton- It is evidence from the molecular formula that it is highly unsaturated.
Like benzene, it is also i.
Resistant to addition reactions ii.
Resistant to common oxidizing agents iii.
Does not decolourise alkaline potassium tetraoxomanganate(vii) solution Like benzene it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions despite its unsaturation.
So pyridine exhibits aromatic character.
Its aromatic nature is further supported by the following: i. It’s alkyl derivatives are readily oxidized to pyridine carboxylic acids [O] H CC H N HOOCC H N 3 5 4 5 4 α-, β-, or γ- Picolines α-, β- or γ-Pyridinecarboxylic acids ii.
The amino derivatives of pyridine can be diazotized and coupled with phenols or amines etc, like aminobenzene iii.
The halopyridine shows nucleophilic displacement of halogen by –NH2, -OH, -CN etc like the halogen of halonitrobenzenes.
The present day structure shows that pyridine is a resonance structure of the following structures: + N N N + _ + N N N Resonance representation of pyridine  178 - All the carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms lie in the same plane - The four carbon-carbon bond lengths in pyridine are equal- 1.39Ǻ and the carbon – hydrogen bond length are equal-1.37Ǻ.
- It resists addition due to the absence of true double bonds - Due to the presence of positive charges at the 2- or 4- position in the contributing structure, it behaves as deactivated system in electrophilic substitution, which occurs at position-3.
- It’s resonance energy is 23kcal/mol as compared to -6 kcal/mol in ordinary conjugated trienes.
From the molecular orbital concept, the nitrogen and each of the carbon atoms in pyridine are in the sp2 hybridisation state.
They combine together to form a ring utilizing two of their sp2 hybrid trigonal orbitals for forming α-bonds.
The remaining sp2 orbital at the five carbon atoms overlap with s-orbital of hydrogen to form σ-bonds while the third sp2 orbital of the nitrogen contains the lone pair of electrons which remains unshared.
The unhybridised p orbitals at each of the carbon and nitrogen atom overlaps with each other to form π cloud of electrons below and above the plane of the ring like in benzene.
Fig 1.1 Molecular Orbital Picture of Pyridine (Source: A Textbook of Organic Chemistry,3rd Edition-By K.S Tewari and N.K.Vishnoi) However, due to greater electronegativity of nitrogen, the π- electron cloud is displaced slightly towards nitrogen and the electron density is below unity at all carbon atoms.
Position three is the least affected and it is the position with the highest electron density, making it the favoured position for electrophilic substitution.

For example, the oxalic acid is obtained from a plant of the oxalis group.
Using the IUPAC system the suffix dioic acid is added to the name of the parent alkane.

State: All dicarboxylic acids are colourless crystalline solids ii.
Solubility: Lower members are soluble in water.
Solubility in water decreases as molecular mass increases while in ether the solubility increases as molecular mass increases iii.
Melting points: Melting points of acids with even number of carbon atoms are higher than those with odd number of carbon atoms.
This is because the arrangement of the carbon atoms is zigzag in odd number acids with the two carboxyl groups on the same side, while they are on opposite sides in even number acids.
iv.
Acid strength of these acids decrease with increase in molecular weight.
Dicarboxylic acids dissociate in two steps: K1 HOOC−COOH OOC−COOH + H+ K2 OOC−COOH OOC−COO + H+ The first dissociation constant K1 is higher than the second dissociation constant K2.
It is also higher than that of the corresponding monocarboxylic acid.
The higher value of K1 is due to the –I effect of one carboxylic group on the other.
This effect becomes weaker due to intervening effect of −CH group between two 2 O O HOOC− C HOOC−CH −CH −C 2 2 O− H O −H K1 = 54 K1 = 6.4 × 10-5  187 carboxyl groups.
The lower value of K2 is due to +I effect of carboxyl group (- COO).
Further the electrostatic repulsion due to negative charges at the ends of the dianion (OOC−COO) destabilizes the dianion and reduce the K2 value.
3.4 General Chemical Properties The chemical reactions of dicarboxylic acids are mainly governed by the reactivity of the carboxyl groups.
Oxalic acid differs from the other members because it does not contain the hydrocarbon chain and it consists of two carboxyl groups only.
I.
Reaction due to carboxyl group: Dicarboxylic acids show the usual reactions of carboxyl group.
However, because they have two carboxyl groups they form two series of salts, esters, amides and other acid derivatives.
For example, succinic acid form the following derivatives: CH COONa CH COOC H CH COCl CH COONH 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 | | | | CH COOH CH COOH CH COOH CH COOH 2 2 2 2 Acid sodium acid ethyl acid succinyl acids succinamide Succinate succinate chloride CH COONa CH COOC H CH COCl CH CONH 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 | | | | CH COONa CH COOC H CH COCl CH CONH 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 Sodium Ethyl Succinyl Succinamide Succinate succinate chloride II.
Action of Heat: The product formed on heating depends on the relative positions of the two carboxyl groups.
i.
When two carboxyl groups are attached to the same carbon, e.g oxalic acid, malonic acids, CO is given off: 2 COOH | heat HCOOH + CO 2 COOH Formic acid Oxalic acid COOH H C heat CH COOH + CO 2 3 2 COOH Acetic acid Malonic acid ii.
Higher acids in which the carboxyl groups are separated by two or three carbon atoms lose a molecule of water on heating or by distilling with acetic anhydride to give the corresponding anhydride.

When the carboxyl groups are separated by four or more carbon atoms e.g Adipic and pimelic acids, cyclic ketones are formed when distilled with acetic anhydride.
CH −CH −COOH CH −CH 2 2 2 2 | heat | O + H O + CO 2 2 CH −CH −COOH CH −CH 2 2 2 2 Adipic acid Cyclopentanone CH CH COOH CH CH 2 2 2 2 H C heat H C O + H O + CO 2 2 2 2 CH CH COOH CH CH 2 2 2 Pimelic acid Cyclohexanone Ketone is formed when the calcium salt of adipic and pimelic acids are heated.
CH CH COO CH CH 2 2 2 2 Ca heat CO + CaCO 3 CH CH COO CH CH 2 2 2 Calcium adipate Cyclopentanone The products from the action of heat on dicarboxylic acids can be summed up by Blanc’s rule that state that on distilling alone or with acetic anhydride at 300OC, a dicarboxylic acid may yield an anhydride or a cyclic ketone according to the relative positions of carboxyl groups.
1:4 and 1;5 dicarboxylic acids give anhydride, while 1:6 and 1:7 dicarboxylic acids yield cyclic ketones and 1:8 or higher dicarboxylic acids undergo intermolecular dehydration to form linear polymers.
iv.
Higher dicarboxylic acid(1:8 dicarboxylic acids) undergo intermolecular dehydration to form linear polymers.

3.5 Uses of Dicarboxylic acids Oxalic acid, a common dicarboxylic acid is used in the manufacture of inks, metal polishes, and oxalates.
It is also used for textile printing.
3.6 Reactive Methylene Group in reactions When a methylene group is present between two strongly electronegative (electron attracting) group such as >C=O or −C≡N, the hydrogen atoms of methylene group (called α- hydrogen, being present on carbon atom next to functional groups on either side) become reactive or acidic.
Such compounds exist in keto – enol equilibrium.
If the compound is symmetrical the hydrogen atom of the methylene group migrates to either of the keto groups but if the compound is unsymmetrical only one form is present exclusively or predominantly and the migration of the hydrogen atom depends upon the inductive effect of the alkyl or other groups present on either side of >CH group.

It is sparingly soluble in water, but soluble in alcohol, benzene and chloroform 3.7.3 Chemical Properties The structure of malonic ester shows the presence of two carbonyl groups, one each on either side of methylene group, this exerts a –I effect.
Also Malonic ester is from an anion which is stabilized by resonance since it can exist in two forms - enol and keto forms.The presence of the methylene group, added to the formation of resonance stabilized anion make the hydrogen of the group active (acidic).
It exists in following keto-enol tautomeric forms, the enol form being present in much smaller amount.

5.0 Summary In this unit we have learnt that: i. Dicarboxylic acids contain two carboxyl groups.
ii.
Dicarboxylic acids may be saturated and they may be unsaturated.
iii.
Saturated dicarboxylic acids have the general formula C H (COOH) ., n may be equal or n 2n 2 greater than 0. iv.
In naming dicarboxylic acids using the IUPAC system the suffix dioic acid is added to the name of the parent alkane.
v. In the common system, the position of substituents is indicated by Greek letters while in the IUPAC system, it is indicated by numbers.
vi.
Dicarboxylic acids show position isomerism.
vii.
General Methods of Preparation are : - By oxidation of dihydric alcohols.
- Hydrolysis of dicyanides or cyano acids - By treating halogen substituted monocarboxylic acid ester with zinc or silver and hydrolysing the ester thus obtained.
203 - By reduction of unsaturated dicarboxylic acid - By hydrolysis of aqueous solution of potassium alkyl ester of dibasic acid - By oxidation of cyclic ketone - From Grignard reagent of dihaloalkane.
- By oxidation of unsaturated acids - By the action of dihaloalkanes on sodiomalonic ester viii.
All dicarboxylic acids are colourless crystalline solids, Lower members are soluble in water.
Solubility in water decreases as molecular mass increases while in ether the solubility increases as molecular mass increases.Melting points of acids with even number of carbon atoms are higher than those with odd number of carbon atoms.
Acid strength of these acids decrease with increase in molecular weight.
ix.Dicarboxylic acids dissociate in two steps: K1 HOOC−COOH OOC−COOH + H+ K2 OOC−COOH OOC−COO + H+ The first dissociation constant K1 is higher than the second dissociation constant K2.
x.
The chemical reactions of dicarboxylic acids are mainly governed by the reactivity of the carboxyl groups.
- Dicarboxylic acids show the usual reactions of carboxyl group and they form two series of salts, esters, amides and other acid derivatives because they have two carboxyl groups.
- Action of Heat: The product formed on heating depends on the relative positions of the two carboxyl groups.
xi.
When a methylene group is present between two strongly electronegative (electron attracting) group such as >C=O or −C≡N, the hydrogen atoms of methylene group (called α- hydrogen, being present on carbon atom next to functional groups on either side) become reactive or acidic.
x.When a compound containing active methylene group reacts with a strong base the proton removal may take place from both, keto and enol forms and the resultant enolate (a carbanion stabilized by an adjacent carbonyl group, is often called an enolate ion).
xi.
Functional groups like nitro, ester etc.
also make methylene group reactive.

The building units of proteins are called amino acids.
The majority of proteins is from some twenty common  208 amino acids, linked up by peptide (amide) bonds in a specific sequence characteristic of the particular protein 2.0 Objectives At the end of this unit you should be able to: i.

State methods of testing protein xii.
State uses of protein 3.0 Amino Acids Amino acids are the amino substituted acids containing both amino (-NH ) and carbonyl 2 (-COOH) group(s).
They are the building units of proteins.
3.1 Naming Amino acids The IUPAC names of amino acids are obtained by indicating the position of the amino group by Arabic numeral on the alkyl radical chain of the alkanoic acid, making the carboxylic carbon the number 1 carbon.
Simple amino acids having only one amino and carboxyl groups may be classified as α-, β-, γ- and δ- etc amino acids depending on the position of the amino group with respect to carboxyl group.
For example: α- Amino acids H NCH COOH Aminoacetic acid(Glycine) 2 2 CH CH(NH )COOH α-Aminopropionic acid or 2-Aminopropanoic acid(Alanine).
3 2 C H CH CH(NH )COOH α-Amino-β-phenyl propanoic acid(Phenyl alanine).
6 5 2 2 β- Amino acids H NCH CH COOH β-Aminopropionic acid or 3-Aminopropanoic acid 2 2 2 CH CH(NH )CH COOH β-Aminobutyric acid or 3-Aminobutanoic acid 3 2 2 γ- Amino acids NH CH CH CH COOH γ-Aminobutyric acid or 4-Aminobutanoic acid 2 2 2 2 3.1 α-amino acids The α-amino acids are the most important of all because they are the final products of the h yd rolysis of p ep tid es and p ro tein s. Majority of the amino acids obtained in natu re are α-  209 amino acids.
They are known as essential amino acids because they are essential in the diet and their absence in human body retards the growth and may even cause death.
Due to the complexity of their systematic names, shorter names are in common use.
3.2 Classes of α-amino acids They may have one or more than one amino or carboxyl groups and they are classified as follows: i.
Neutral Amino acids: They have equal number of amino acid and carboxyl groups.
For example: H NCH COOH Aminoacetic acid (Glycine) 2 2 HOOCCHH(NH )CH SSCH CH(NH )COOH 2 2 2 2 bis-(2-Amino-2-carboxymethyl)disulphide( Cystine) ii.
Basic Amino Acids: They contain more amino groups than carboxyl groups.
For example: H NCH CH CH CH CH(NH )COOH α,ε-Diaminocaproic acid(lysine) 2 2 2 2 2 2 H NCNHCH CH CH CH(NH )COOH α-Amino-δ-guanidinovalericacid 2 2 2 2 2 ║ (Arginine).
NH iii.
Acidic Amino Acids: They have more carboxyl group than amino group, e.g., HOOCCH CH(NH )COOH Aminosuccinic acid(Aspartic acid) 2 2 HOOCCH CH CH(NH )COOH α-Aminoglutaric acid(Glutanic acid) 2 2 2 3.3 Configuration of Amino acids All amino acids obtained by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins are optically active except glycine, because each one of them have chiral centre which is absent in glycine.
Naturally occurring amino acid has been shown through stereochemical studies to have the same configuration about the α-carbon atom and they resembles L(-)-glyceraldehyde.
3.5 Methods of synthesis of α-amino acids a. Amination of α-halogenated acids.
An α- chloro or bromo substituted acid is treated with concentrated ammonia to gives an α-amino acid.
CH CHClCOOH + 2NH CH CH(NH )COOH + NH Cl 3 3 3 2 4 α-chloropropionic acid α-Aminopropionic acid b.
From Aldehydic and ketonic acids: When the acid is treated with hydroxylamine and the resulting oxime reduced by aluminium amalgam, it gives α-amino acid.

For example in the preparation of leucine: (CH ) CHCH Br + NaCH(COOC H ) -NaBr (CH ) CHCH CH(COOC H ) 3 2 2 2 5 2 3 2 2 2 5 2 Isobutyl bromide sodiomalonic ester (i) KOH (ii) HCl (CH ) CHCH CH(COOH) Br (CH ) CHCH CBr(COOH) 3 2 2 2 2 3 2 2 2 Heat (CH ) CHCH CH(Br)COOH NH (CH ) CHCH(NH )COOH 3 2 2 3 3 2 2 -CO α-bromo-idocaproic acid Leucine 2 3.5 General Physical Characteristics i. Amino acids are crystalline solids with fairly high melting points and densities ii.
They are soluble in polar solvents like water iii.
They are insoluble in non-polar solvents like petroleum ether, alcohol and benzene iv.
They all occur in optically active forms except glycine v. The dipole moments for amino acids are high.
vi.
They behave as if they are neither basic nor acidic These facts point towards their dipolar ion or zwitter ion structure.
In solut ion this zwitter ion is in equilibrium with a little of the covalent form.
H N+CHRCOOH + H O 3 2 B H O+ 3 H N+CHRCOO H NCHRCOOH 3 2 zwitter ion amino acid form A OH H NCHRCOO + H O 2 2 C When an acid is added to the solution of the amino acid the zwitter ion (A) is converted to the cation B because the stronger acid make a proton available to the carboxylate and a cation results.
However, when a strong base is added to the amino acid, the zwitter ion (A) is converted to anion C, because the strong base OH takes away a proton from the ammonium ion forming an anion.
Thus in strongly acid medium the amino acids will migrate towards the cathode in an electric field and in presence of a strong base they will migrate towards the anode.
This is exactly what happens to the amino acids in an electric field and hence it further proves the zwitter ion structure of the amino acids.
211 Activity A/Self Assessment Exercise Amino acids behave as if they are neither basic nor acidic.
Explain 3.5.1 Isoelectric Point It is possible that at a particular pH the concentration of cation B may be exactly equal to the concentration of anion C and hence at that pH there will be no resultant migration of amino acid in an electric field.
Such a pH at which an amino acid does not migrate in an electric field is the ‘Isoelectric point’ (pI) of that amino acid.
At this point the concentration of the zwitter ion is maximum.
The isoelectric point is an individual characteristics of an amino acid and depends on the basicity of the amino group and the acidity of the carboxyl group, which varies with the nature of alkyl group,-R.
Thus pI is 6.0 for glycine, 5.5 for phenyl alanine and 3.2 for glutamic acid.
The following equilibrium exists between A, B and C: H+ H+ H NCHRCOO H N+CHRCOO H NCHRCOOH 2 3 2 OH OH B A C An amino acid usually shows its lowest solubility in a solution at the isoelectric point, since at this point, there is the highest concentration of the dipolar ion.
This knowledge is of great value in separation of an amino acid from a mixture.

They are linked through an amide linkage.
Chains of amino acid residues, linked through amide linkage formed by the interaction of -COOH group of one and -NH 2 group of the another, with elimination of water, are known as peptides and the linkage (-CO.NH-) as peptide linkage.

They form an essential part of animal diet.
An animal cannot live for long without protein diet though it can without fats and carbohydrates.
3.8.1 Occurrences Proteins occur in the protoplasm of all animal and plant cells.
They constitute nearly three fourth of the dry material of most living systems.
Plants build up their protein using carbon (IV) oxide, water, nitrates and ammonium salts in presence of energy obtained from the sun, animals and human beings take plant and animal protein in their food which are hydrolysed to amino acids in the system by enzymes.
Protein is resynthesised in the animal and human system from these amino acids.
They are necessary for growth of the animal body and also for replacing proteins lost in the process of living.
Some important sources of proteins and percentage of proteins in them by weight are given in table 1.1 below.
Table 1.1 Percentage protein from different sources of protein Source Protein% Source Protein% Soya beans 43.2 Groundnut 26.7 Pea 28.2 Cashewnut 21.2 Milk powder, skimmed 38 Almonds 20.8 Milk powder, whole 25.2 Egg yolk 13.7 Fish 21.5 Oat meal 13.6 Mutton 18.5 Wheat 11.8 3.8.2 Composition of Proteins Proteins are complex nitrogenous organic compounds containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus besides nitrogen.
Some proteins contain halogens and metals also.
216 The composition of a protein varies according to the source but an approximation can be as: Carbon 50-55 percent; hydrogen 6-7.5 per cent; nitrogen 15-17 per cent; oxygen 21-24 per cent; sulphur 0.2-2.2 per cent and phosphorous 0.1-1 per cent.
Proteins are built up from α-amino acids units.
A protein molecule may have hundreds or thou sands of amino acid s. There are 23 α-amino acids which by different but precise modes of linking may form an exceedingly large number of different protein molecules.
Out of these, ten amino acids are such that they are not synthesized in the human system and are therefore termed as essential.
They have to be supplied to the animal system from external sources.
3.8.3 Classification of Proteins Proteins have been classified based on several parameters.
According to their solubility and physical properties they are classified into: (a) Simple proteins, (b) Conjugated proteins, and (c) Derived proteins.
a.
Simple proteins.
These on hydrolysis give only amino acids.
For examples: - Albumis.
Serum albumin, egg albumin and lactalbumin.
- Globulins.
Serum globulin, tssue globulin and vegetable globulin (in seeds and nuts).
- Prolamines.
Zein ( from maize), and gliadin (from wheat).
- Glutelins.
Glutenin (from wheat) and oryzenin (from rice).
- Scleroproteins.
Keratin (from hair) and fiborin (from silk).
- Histones.
Occur in nucleic acids and haemoglobin.
- Protamines.
Occur in nucleic acids.
b. Conjugated proteins.
These proteins have a non-protein part in their molecule.
This non-protein part is also referred to as prosthetic group.
It is possible to separate the prosthetic group by careful hydrolysis.
Some examples and their prosthetic group are given below: i. Nucleoproteins.
The prosthetic group is nucleic acid and the proteins are found in nucleus of the cell.
ii.
Glycoproteins.
The non-protein part is a carbohydrate or its derivative.
It is found in ‘egg-white’.
iii.
Chromoproteins.
These have a coloured prosthetic group; especially a pyrrole derivative.
The coloured prosthetic groups usually contain a metal e.g., Fe, Cu, Mg etc.
Examples are chlorophyll and haemogogbin.
iv.
Phosphoproteins.
These have a phosphoric acid residue in some form (other than nucleic acids or lipoproteins).
Examples are casein (from milk) and viteline (from egg yolk).
v. Lipoproteins These have a lipid such as lecithin, cephalin etc.
as prospthetic group.
c. Derived proteins.
These are the degradation products, corresponding to various stages, in the hydrolysis of simple or conjugated proteins by acid, alkali or enzymes.
Another classification of proteins into (i) Globular and (ii) fibrous proteins is based on their functions and molecular shapes.
217 i. Globular proteins.
They are nearly spherical in shape, soluble in water and in dilute acids, bases etc.
their important function is the maintenance and regulation of life- processes in the living organisms.
All enzymes, many hormones, antibodies, haemoglobin etc.
are the examples of this class of proteins.
ii.
Fibrous proteins.
They have a thread like structure and are present in fibre like form.
They are soluble in water, dilute acids and bases.
They form the main structural material of animal tissues.
For example, Keratin (the protein present in skin, hair, nails etc.
), myosin (present in muscles), collagen etc., 3.8.4 Physical Characteristics of Proteins Different proteins have different physical properties but their general physical properties can be summarized as given below: i.
Except chromoproteins, they are colourless, tasteless and odourless.
Mostly they are amorphous but some are crystalline when pure.
They do not have a sharp melting point.
ii.
Most of them are insoluble in alcohol and water but they dissolve in dilute acid and alkalis.
Some proteins like those present in skin and hair are, however, insoluble.
iii.
They have high molecular weight since the proteins molecules are very complex having thousands of atoms.
iv.
They are colloidal in nature.
They are hydrophilic colloids which cannot pass through vegetable or animal membrane.
Some of the proteins form thick transluscent sols with water which can set to gels on cooling.
v. Reversible precipitation.
On addition of sodium chloride, ammonium sulphate, magnesium sulphate and some alkaline earth-salts some proteins are precipitated.
The precipitate can be filtered and redissolved in water.
This fact can be made use of in separation of some proteins.
vi.
Denaturation.
When heated or acted upon by reagents like alcohols, heavy metal salts (HgCl , CuSO etc.
), picric acid or alkaline earth-salts, proteins are coagulated.
2 4 Denaturation occurs most readily at the isoelectric point and is believed to take place because of unfolding of the proteins molecule.
During denaturation the secondary and tertiary structure unfolds but the primary structure remains intact.
There is loss of biological activity and change in the physical properties during denaturation but the chemical reactivity increases due to opening up of various functional groups.
Denaturation is generally irreversible but there are many examples of reversible nature when it is called renaturation.
Gentle treatment of protein with urea or slow cooling help the process of renaturation.
vii.
Isoelectric point.
Every protein has a characteristic isoelectric point at which its ionization and solubility is minimum.
This property is made use of in the isolation and identification of proteins by electrophoretic methods.
Activity C/Self Assessment Exercise  218 a.
Distinguish between peptise, polypeptide and proteins b.
What are the various classes of proteins?
3.8.5 Chemical Characteristics of Proteins i.
They are amphoteric nature Since proteins have free —NH and -COOH groups they react with both, the 2 acidic and basic substances.
ii.
Hydrolysis Proteins are hydrolysed by dilute acids and alkalis or by enzymes.
The products of hydrolysis are proteoses; peptones, polypeptides, simple peptides and α-amino acids.
iii.
Oxidation Oxidation of proteins occurs during burning or decay.
The products, depending upon the conditions of oxidation, are nitrogen, amines and carbon dioxide.
An animal body during decay suffers bacterial oxidation producing all these products and the offensive smell is due to various amines, cyanides etc.
produced.
3.8.6 Colour Reactions of Proteins These reactions serve as test for proteins.
The entire test may not be positive for every protein but majority of these should be positive for a protein i. Biuret test On adding a dilute solution of copper tetraoxosulphate(VI) to alkaline solut ion of protein, a violet colour may be obtained.
This test is on account of the likely formation of biuret (H N.CONH.CONH ) as an intermediate.
2 2 ii.
Xantho-proteic test When a protein solution is warmed with trioxonitrate (V) acid, a yellow colour is obtained.
On making the reaction mixture alkaline with ammonia the colour changes to orange.
iii.
Libermann’s test Proteins containing tryptophan on being boiled with concentrated hydrochloric acid followed by the addition of a few drops of sucrose solution give violet colour.
iv.
Millon’s test When Millon’s reagent (mercurous and mercuric nitrate in HNO ) is added to a 3 protein solution, a white precipitate which turns red on heating may be formed.
This is due to a phenolic -OH group in the protein molecule.
v. Nitroprusside test This test is applicable to certain proteins containing -SH group They produce transient red colour on adding nitroprusside solution.
vi.
Lead sulphide test Proteins containing –S-S- or -SH group when boiled with NaOH and lead acetate produce black precipitate of lead sulphide.
vii.
Molisch test  219 Protein solution is mixed with alcoholic solution of α-naphthol and concentrated H SO is poured down along the side of the test-tube.
Proteins, containing 2 4 carbohydrate residue give violet colour at the junction of two liquids in the test- tube.
viii.
Ninhyrin test This is a very delicate test and consists in reaction of pyridine solution of a protein with ninhydrin.
A deep blue, violet-pink or red colour is indicative of a protein.
This test is due to free -NH and -COOH groups of protein and is also 2 shown by amino acids 3.8.7 Structure of Proteins The problem of structure of protein has been tackled at different levels.
At the first level of a. a.
Primary Structure At the level of primary structure determination, the number, nature and sequence of amino acids forming peptide chains of the protein are determined.
This can be done by: i. Isolating the proteins in pure state ii.
Determining the sub-units necessary if results indicate the presence of more than one C or N end groups.
iii.
Hydrolysing the proteins to get the amino acids which are identified and extimated quantitatively iv.
Determining the molecular weight by amino acid percentage composition and physical methods v. Determining the sequence of amino acids by carrying out C-terminal and N-terminal analysis.
b.
Secondary Structure This step deals with the arrangement of the peptide chains in space to form coils, sheet and other structures which are held together by hydrogen bond, electrostatic forces and inter and intramolecular forces.
The hydrogen bonds are formed between the carboxylic oxygen and hydrogen of –NH group.
The force of electrostatic attraction or repulsion also operates between the charged polar groups.
To this is the added influence of the inter and intramolecular bonds like disulphide bond.
The α-helix was structure is the generally acceptably structure.
In this structure the hydrogen bond occurs between different –CO and – NH group of the same chain which holds helix.
Stereochemical study shows that a helix with 3.7 residues per turn is the most stable.
Hydrogen bonding exist between the –CO group of one residue and –NH group of the fourth residue in the helix.
The stability of the α-helical structure is also due to resonance between the –NH and –CO groups in the peptide chain.
O O  ║ | + −C−N− −C=N− | | H H  220 Figure 1.1: Helical structure of protein c. Tertiary Structure The coiling or folding of long peptide chains give rise to a three dimensional structure which is called the tertiary structure.
It involves hydrogen, ionic inter and intra molecular bonds.
Hydrophobic bonds is given rise to by the alkyl side chains of the amino acid which is hydrophobic in character.
The polar group with high affinity for water (hydrophilic) tend to take positions on the surface of the globular proteins.
d. Quaternary structure This arises from the association of various identical or different sub-units.
Each sub-unit has its primary, secondary and tertiary structures.
3.8.8 Uses of Proteins i.

They are known as essential amino acids because they are essential in the diet.
5.0 Summary In this unit we have learnt that: i. Proteins are macromolecules with very high relative molecular masses.
221 ii.
Amino acids are the amino substituted acids containing both amino (-NH ) and 2 carbonyl (-COOH) group(s).
iii.
The IUPAC names of amino acids are obtained by indicating the position of the amino group by Arabic numeral on the alkyl radical chain of the alkanoic acid, making the carboxylic carbon the number 1 carbon.
iv.
Simple amino acids having only one amino and carboxyl groups may be classified as α-, β-, γ- and δ- etc amino acids depending on the position of the amino group with respect to carboxyl group.

The dipole moments for amino acids are high.They behave as if they are neither basic nor acidic x.
The pH at which an amino acid does not migrate in an electric field is the ‘Isoelectric point’ (pI) of that amino acid.
The isoelectric point is an individual characteristic of an amino acid and depends on the basicity of the amino group and the acidity of the carboxyl group, which varies with the nature of alkyl group.

3.0 Occurrence and Composition of Fats Fats are the main constituents of the storage fat cells in animals and plants and they are one of the important food reserves of living organism.
These plant and animal fats can be extracted.
Liquid fats are often referred to as oils.
Carboxylic acids found in natural fats and oils are mainly unbranched.
They can be divided into two groups: saturated and unsaturated.
Saturated carboxylic acids have single bonds in their hydrocarbon chains only and they are found in animals, while unsaturated carboxylic acids contain at least one C=C double in their chains and they are obtained in plants.
Carboxylic acids with more than one C=C double bonds are known as polyunsaturated.
Saturated carboxylic acids are solids at room temperature.
This is because the regular nature of their aliphatic chains allows the molecules to be packed in a close, parallel alignment.
Unsaturated carboxylic acids are liquids at room temperature.
It is because the double bonds in the hydrocarbon chains interrupt the regular packing.
Thus the important difference between oils and fats is that oils are liquids at ordinary temperature while fats are solids.

Distinguish between fats and oil b.
What are the differences between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids 3.1 Formation of Fats and Oils When a molecule of glycerol, i.e propane-1,2,3-triol, reacts with a molecule of stearic acid, glyceryl monostearate is formed.
The product formed may then react with another molecule of stearic acid to form glyceryl distearate, which further reacts to give glyceryl tristearate.
The glyceryl tristearate formed is a solid.
It is a fat.
If glycerol reacts with other fatty acids to form a liquid product, then it is oil.
In fact, most natural fats and oils are mixed glycerides.
They are esters formed from propane- 1,2,3-triol and a mixture of different long chain carboxylic acids, such as linoleic, stearic and oleic acids.
3.2 Structure of Fats and Oils Fats and oils are obtained by the combination of propane-1,2,3-triol with fatty acids, which are long chain carboxylic acids.

Oils and fats are colourless liquids or solids(may be yellow or brown due to impur ities).
ii.
Vegetable oils have lower boiling points than animal fats because they generally have a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids.
The more highly unsaturated the acyl group in a triglyceride, the lower it’s melting point.
iii.

Activity B/Self Assessment Exercise Which of the following fatty acids has the highest melting points?

Drying Some oils containing glycerides of unsaturated acids with two or three double bonds have the property of slowly absorbing oxygen from the air and then polymerises to form a hard transparent coating used in making paints and oil cloth.
This process is known as drying and the oils as drying oil.
Examples of these oils are linoleic, eleostearic and licanic acids.
Drying take place much more readily if the acids contains conjugated system of double bonds e.g in eleostearic and licanic acids unlike in acids containing non- conjugated double bonds.
b. Rancidification Oils and fats, when exposed to air and moisture for a long time during storage undergo slow decomposition and develop unpleasant smell.
The process is known as rancidification.
c. Hydrolysis of Fats and Oils Oils and fats can be hydrolysed to glycerol and the fatty acids by dilute acids, alkalis or superheated steam.
Hydrolysis may also be brought about by enzymes.
Hydrolysis carried out in an alkaline medium is more practical and the reaction is irreversible.
Such process is called saponification.
The reaction can be catalysed by sodium hydroxide.
Propane-1,2,3-triol and mixture of sodium salts of carboxylic acids, called soap, are then produced.

When hydrogen is passed them under pressure in the presence of finely divided nickel or Raney nickel, the unsaturated glycerides becomes saturated and the oil becomes solid or semi-solid.
This process is known as hydrogenation and the solid oil is known as margarine.It improves the colour,odour and taste of oils.

Take the triglyceride in (a) above through acid and alkali hydrolysis and predict the products formed 3.4 Analysis of Fats and Oils The value of a particular oil depends on it’s composition and purity.
Some of the usual physical tests to determine the purity of fats and oil are melting point, specific gravity, refractive index and viscosity.
Some of the chemical tests are: i.
Acid value: It indicates the amounts of free fatty acids present in an oil or fat.
It is the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide required to neutralise the free organic acids present in 1gm of fat or oil.
It is determined by dissolving a weighed quantity of oil or fat in alcohol and titrating against standard alkali, using phenolphthalein as indicator.
A high acid value indicates a stale oil or fat.
ii.
Saponification : This is the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide required to completely saponify 1gm of fat or oil- or completely neutralise the fatty acids resulting from complete hydrolysis of 1gm fat or oil.
Saponification gives an idea about the molecular weight of fats or oil.
The smaller the saponification value , the higher the molecular weight.
It is also useful in calculating the amount of alkali needed to convert a definite amount of fat or iol into soap and in detecting the alteration of a fat or oil by one of lower or higher saponification value.
The difference between saponification value and acid value is known as ester value of the fat or oil.
iii.
Iodine Value One structural difference between fats and oils is the degree of unsaturation.
Solid animal fats contain mainly saturated carboxylic acids while vegetable oils contain large amounts of unsaturated carboxylic acids.
As unsaturated carboxylic acids cannot be synthesized by our body, they are essential in the diet.
Therefore, it is useful to have a quantitative measure of the degree of unsaturation in fats and oils.
A convenient reference for the purpose is the iodine value.
Its determination is  232 based on the reaction between iodine and the carbon-carbon double bond in fats and oils.
In practice, the more reactive iodine monochloride is used.
H H H H | | | | −C=C− + I −C−C− 2 Unsaturated fats and oil combine with iodine readily, whereas saturated fats and oils do not.
The more unsaturated the fats and the oil is, the more iodine it will react with.
The iodine value of fats or and oil is defined as the number of grams of iodine that reacts with 100g of the fat or oil.
The higher the iodine value, the greater is the degree of unsaturation of the fat or oil.
It also gives an idea of the drying character of the fat or oil.
Generally, vegetable oils have higher values than animal fats.
This shows that vegetable oils are more unsaturated.
It has been found that animal fats have iodine values less than 70, while vegetable oils are more than 70. iv.
Reichert-Meissi(R.M.
)Value: It measure the volatile fatty acids present as glycerides in oil or fats.
It is defined as the number of ml of 0.1N potassium hydroxide solution required to neutralise the distillate of 5g of hydrolysed fat or oil.
v. Acetyl Value: It is defined as the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide required to neutralise acetic acid liberated by the saponification of one gram of completely acetylated oil or fat.
the distillate of 5g of hydrolysed fat or oil.
It measures the alcoholic group present in oil or fat.
vi.
Polenske value: t is defined as the number of ml of 0.1N potassium hydroxide solution required to neutralise the steam volatile, but water insoluble fatty acids obtained from the distillate of 5g of hydrolysed fat or oil.

3.5 Uses of Fats and Oil i.
Used as food ii.
Used in the manufacture of soap.alycerol,candle, margarine, hair creams etc iii.
Long chain alcohols prepared from fats and oils are used in the preparation of synthetic detergents iv.
Used in the manufacture of paints and vanishes v. Used in the manufacture of oil cloth and linoleum 3.6 Soaps Soaps are metallic salts of higher fatty acids such as stearic, palmitic and oleic acids.
They are manufactured by cold , semi-boiled or boiled processes.
Ordinary soap today is a mixture of sodium salts of long-chain fatty acids because the fat from which it is made is a mixture.
233 Soap may vary in composition and methods of processing; it may be Castile soap, if made from olive oil; alcohol may be added to make it transparent; air may be beaten into it to make it float; perfumes,dyes,and germicides may be added; if a potassium salt instead of a sodium salt, it is soft soap.
In solution, soap is dispersed in spherical clusters called micelles, each of which may contain hundreds of soap molecules.
A soap molecule has a polar end, -COONa+, and a non-polar end, the long carbon chain of 12-18 carbons.
The polar end is water soluble-hydrophilic while the non-polar end is hydrophobic or lipophilic.
Molecules that have both polar and non-polar end and are are big enough for each end to display its own solubility behaviour are called amphipathic.
In solut ion, the po lar ends projects towards the polar solvent-water, while the non –polar end seeks for a non-po lar environment – the non-polar ends of other soap molecules.
3.6.1 Cleaning action of soap The problem in cleaning is the fat and grease that make up and contain dirt.
Water alone cannot dissolve these hydrophobic substances because when oil substance is in contact with water, it tends to coalesce so that there is a water layer and an oil layer.
However, the presence of soap changes the situation.
The non-polar ends of soap molecules dissolves in the oil droplet, leaving the carboxylate ends projecting into the surrounding water layer .
Repulsion between similar charges keeps the oil droplets from coalescing; a stable emulsion of oil and water forms and can be removed from the surface being cleaned.
Hard water contains calcium and magnesium salts which reacts with soap to form insoluble calcium and magnesium carboxylates.
3.6.2.Synthetic Detergents They are called soapless detergents or syndets.
They are more resistant to hard water than soaps.
Like soaps the contain both hydrophilic-water soluble and hydrophobic –oil soluble part.
They have replaced soap to large extent.

Explain 4.0 Conclusion Fats and oils are esters of glycerol with higher fatty acids and are called glycerides.
Saturated carboxylic acids contain single bond and they are solids at room temperature while unsaturated carboxylic acids contain at least one C=C and they are liquids at room temperature.
The important difference between oils and fats is that oils are liquids at ordinary temperature while fats are solids.
Soaps are metallic salts of higher fatty acids such as stearic, palmitic and oleic acids.
Synthetic detergents like soaps, contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic end.

They have the general formula C H O They cannot be hydrolysed to simpler compounds.They 6 12 6 .
are the basic unit of carbohydrates.They have three to seven carbon atoms, and each has one aldehyde or one ketone functional group.
The aldehyde group is always at the end of the carbon chain; the ketone group is always on the second carbon of the chain.
In either case, there is a –CH OH group at the other end of the chain.
2 There are hydroxyl groups on all the carbon atom and the –CH OH at the other end, and on 2 the end carbon next to the ketone group.
H O CH OH 2 C | | C=O | CH OH CH OH 2 2 Disaccharides consist of two monosaccharide units joined together by a glycosidic bond.
Their general formula is C H O .
E.g sucrose, maltose and lactose.
When one molecule of 12 22 11 disaccharides is taken through acid hydrolysis, it yields two monosaccharide molecules.
240 Polysaccharides are condensation polymers of monosaccharides, they contain thousands of monosaccharide units in their structures.
They have the general formula (C H O ) , where n 6 10 5 n is a very large number.
On acid hydrolysis polysaccharides yield a large number of monosaccharide molecules, e.g.
cellulose, starch, inulin and glycogen.
Polysaccharides are futher subdivided into homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharide.
The homopolysaccharides on hydrolysis produce the same molecule while heteropolysaccharides produce different monosaccharides.
Starch and cellulose are homopolysaccharides while inulin is a heteropolysaccharide.
Carbohydrates that reduces Fehling’s (or Benedict’s) or Tollens’ reagent are known as reducing sugars.
All monosaccharides whether aldose or ketose, are reducing sugars.
Most disaccharides are reducing sugars.

Sucrose v. Glucose 3.1 Monosaccharides Monossaccharides may be an aldose or a ketose.
An aldose is a monosaccharide with an aldehyde carbonyl group while a ketose contains a ketone structure.
3.1.1 Naming Monosaccharides The family name ending ‘–ose’ indicates a carbohydrate, and simple sugars are known by common names like glucose, ribose, and fructose rather than systematic names.
The number of carbon atoms in an aldose or ketose can be specified by one of the prefixes bi-,tri-,tetr-, pent-, hex-,hept-.
Thus, glucose is an aldohexose( aldo- = aldehyde; hex- = six carbons; -ose = sugar); fructose is a ketohexose( a six-carbon ketone sugar); and ribose is an aldopentose(a five-carbon aldehyde sugar).
Most naturally occurring simple sugars are aldehydes with either five or six carbons.

Glycolaldehyde(CH OHCHO) is the simplest hydroxyl aldehyde.
It 2 4 2 2 is regarded as an aldobiose.
It is not optically active because it does not contain an asymmetric carbon.

Trioses(C H O ): Glyceraldehyde is the only aldotriose known.
It possesses an 3 6 3 asymmetric carbon aton an exists in two optically active forms.

Tetroses(C H O ): An aldotetroroses has the formula CH OHCHOHCHOHCHO; it 4 8 2 2 has two asymmetrical carbon atoms.
It is therefore capable of four optically active forms- D- and L- erythrose and D- and L- threose.
242 A ketose has only one asymmetric carbon atom and hence exixts in only two optically active forms- D- and L-erythrulose.

Hexoses: Aldo hexoses have four asymmetric carbon atoms.
They have the formula CH OHCHOHCHOHCHOHCHOHCHO; hence they exist in sixteen optically 2 active forms- D- and L- forms of glucose, mannose, allose, altrose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose.
Ketohexoses have 3 asymmetric carbon atoms and they have the formula CH OHCOCHOHCHOHCHOHCH OH.
They exist in eight optically active 2 2 243 forms of which only six- D- and L-fructose, D- and L-sorbose, D-tagalose and L- psicose- occurs in nature.
Also there are sugars containing heptoses (7-carbon atoms), octoses (8 carbon atoms) and so on.
Activity B/Self Assessment Exercise Classify each of the following monosaccharides as an aldose or ketose, and name each according to the number of carbon atoms: (a) OH OH OH O (b) OH OH O | | | ║ | | ║ HOCH −CH−CH−CH−C−H HOCH −CH−CH−C−H 2 2 (b) O ║ HOCH −C −CH OH 2 2 3.1.2 Configuration Glyceraldehyde contains a central chiral carbon atom.
For each of its optical isomers the (+) and(-) signs indicating dextrorotatory and laevorotatory respectively, specifying the direction in which each one rotates plane polarized light, give no indication of the way in which the groups are attached to the chiral carbon.
The absolute configuration of the two is therefore shown by placing a D or L in front of the name CHO CHO | | H−C−OH HO−C−H | | CH OH CH OH 2 2 D-Glyceraldehyde L- Glyceraldehyde Since all monosaccharides are in effect higher homologue og one of the enantiomers of glyceraldehydes, they are called D-compound if they are related to D- glyceraldehydes and L- compounds if related to L- glyceraldehydes.
The comparism to glyceraldehydes is done by considering the lowest chiral carbon atom.For example, CHO CHO | | H−C−OH HO−C−H | | HO−C−H H−C−OH | | H−C−OH HO−C−H | | H−C−OH HO−C−H | | CH OH CH OH 2 2 D-Glucose L-Glucose  244 Activity C/Self Assessment Exercise a.

Six-membered rings are chemically more stable than the straight chains of the monosaccharides.
The direction from which the –OH adds on to the carbonyl group determines which one of the two possible cyclic structures forms(α- and β-glucose) Most of what we need to know about monosaccharides can be learnt from the study of glucose.
As an aldohexose, it undergoes the following reactions as shown below: 3.2.1 Physical Properties of Glucose i. Glucose posses a sweet taste but this is not quite so immediately distinctive in that of fructose and sucrose.
246 ii.
Glucose is extremely soluble in water iii.
It is insoluble in alcohol iv.
When crystallized from warm solution at 98oC, it yields anhydrous crystals with melting point 146oC, but from cold solut ion, it forms a monohydrate with melting point 86oC.
3.2.2 Reactions of Glucose Glucose undergoes many of the reactions typical of carbonyl compounds.
As a reducing sugar it reacts with Fehling solution and Tollen’s reagent and the formation of osazones provides a useful means of characterization and identification.
Generally the reactions of sugars provide a considerable amount of information about the structure of the molecules and this clearly exemplified by glucose in its ability to form α- and β- cyclic glucosides.
a. Oxidation Glucose, like aldehydes and ketones on warming readily reduces Fehling solution, ammoniacal silver(i) nitrate and Tollen’s reagent.
It can also be oxidised by bromine water to gluconic acid.
However a more powerful oxidizing agent like trioxonitrate(v) acid will oxidize it to the dicarboxylic acid, glycaric acid.

CHO COOH | | (CHOH) 2[H] (CHOH) 4 4 | | CH OH COOH 2 Sorbitol Glucose can also be reduced by hydrogen iodide and red phosphorus at 100oC to give hexane.
This reaction confirms the existence of a straight chain structure for glucose.
c. Acylation Glucose reacts with excess ethanoic anhydride or ethanoyl chloride in the presence of an anhydrous zinc chloride catalyst to yield pentaethanoyl derivative.
This reaction indicates the presence of five hydroxyl groups in glucose.

Reaction with HCN Glucose react with HCN to give hydroxynitrile (cyanohydrins) But do not react with sodium hydrogen sulphite.
When the hydroxylnitrile formed is taken through acid hydrolysis followed by reduction with hydriodic acid, heptanoic acid is formed.
This reaction also indicates the existence of a straight chain structure.

CHO CH=NOH | | (CHOH) + NH OH (CHOH) + H O 4 2 4 2 | | CH OH CH OH 2 2 Glucose oxime Also at room temperature, phenylhydrazine reacts with glucose to form the phenylhydrazone.
The phenylhydrazone remains in solution, however on warming to 100OC in the presence of a large excess of phenylhydrazine, a yellow precipitate of glucose phenylosazone is formed.
The formation of phenylosazone is very useful for characterisation and identification purpose.

This compound formed does not contain aldehyde group as it does not reduce Fehling solution or form oxazone with phenylhydrazine and it exist in two anomeric forms.
This behaviour of glucose can only be accounted for in terms of the α- and β- cyclic structures being in dynamic equilibrium.

It is often called fruit sugar.
3.3.1 Physical Properties of Fructose i.
It is the more soluble in water than glucose ii.
It is the sweetest among all sugars, approximately twice as sweet as glucose iii.
It is reasonably soluble in alcohol unlike glucose.
This property can be utilized in separating it from glucose.
iv.
It is a colourless crystals with the melting point of 95oC 3.3.2 Structures of Fructose Fructose can exist with an acyclic as well as with cyclic structures of six-membered ring and five membered rings.
It is a ketohexose as it contains a keto group in its open chain structure.

In solution, the β-isomer exists in equilibrium with the cyclic α-isomer, with the open-chain structure and also with a five membered ring structure.
The α- and β- isomer differs in configuration of the C-2 atom, i.e at the carbonyl atom of the acyclic structure.
This phenomenon is known as epimerism and the isomers are known as epimers.
The six membered ring structure is known as a fructopyranose while the five membered ring is known as a fructofuranose.
Generally, sugars which contain a six-membered ring structure including the oxygen atom referred to as pyranose compounds and those containing a five-membered ring structure are called furanose compounds.
3.3.3 Reactions of Fructose Fructose undergoes reactions that are similar to those of glucose i. Oxidation: Fructose like glucose reduces Fehling’s solution, ammoniacal silver(I) nitrate and Tollen’s reagent.
It is not however not oxidised by bromine water indicating the absence of an aldehyde group.
ii.
Reduction: Fructose like glucose is also reduced to sorbitol iii.
Acylation: Fructose undergoes acylation as decribed in glucose to yield pentaethanoyl derivative, indicating the presence of five hydroxyl groups in the molecule.
iv.
Addition and Condensation Reactions of the carbonyl group: Like glucose, fructose forms hydroxylnitrile (cyanohydrin) with hydrogen cyanide and condenses with hydroxylamine and hydrazine.
When Fructose is warmed with excess phenylhydrazine, it yields an osazone, fructose phenyl osazone which is similar to the glucose derivative.
v. Fermentation and Dehydration Fermentation and dehydration of fructose is similar to that of glucose.
3.4 Disaccharides Disaccharides are carbohydrates that are made up of two monosaccharide units They have the molecular formula C H O .
On hydrolysis a molecule of disaccharide yields two molecules 12 22 11 of monosaccharide.
Common examples are sucrose(cane or beet sugar), maltose(malt sugar) and lactose(milk sugar).
Sucrose is made up of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule, a maltose consist of two glucose molecules while lactose is made up of one glucose molecule and one galactose molecule.
3.4.1 Natural Sources of Disaccharides Surcose occurs in as much as 15% in cane and beet sugar which is the principal source.
Apart from cane and beet sugar, it occurs naturally in fruit and plants.
Maltose is formed as an intermediate in the fermentation of starch while lactose is present in the milk of mammal in about 5%.
252 3.4.2 Structure and Constitution of Disaccharides The bond formed between two monosaccharides is called a glycosidic linkage.
It is formed from a condensation reaction between two hydroxyl groups.
Disaccharides are glycosides in which the alcohol substituent is replace by another monosaccharide which is attached via one of its hydroxyl groups.
Sucrose is made up of a glucose molecule and a fructose molecule with the elimination of a water molecule- a pyranose and a furanose ring.
A maltose molecule is built up from two glucose molecules with the elimination of a water molecule- two hexose (pyranose).
Maltose and lactose molecules consist of two hexose (or pyranose) units while sucrose has a hexose-pyranose, i.e pyranose-furanose structure.

Maltose and lactose are capable of reducing Fehling solution and forming osazones indicating that the structures of the molecules contain a potentially ‘free’ carbonyl group and a hemiacetal ring structure while sucrose is a non- reducing sugar, indicating the absence of a ‘free’ carbonyl group.
3.4.3 Physical Properties of Disaccharides i. Sucrose, maltose and lactose are readily soluble in water ii.
They are virtually insoluble in alcohol iii.
Sucrose, maltose and lactose are dextrorotatory and are used as foodstuffs.
iv.
If sucrose is heated above 160oC (its melting point), and cooled, it re-solidify to form a solid mass known as ‘barley sugar’.
On raising the temperature to about 200oC, it lost some water molecule to form ‘caramel’- a softer, brownish substance.
3.4.4 Reactions Considering the common examples, many of their reactions are useful means of distinguishing between them.
i. Hydrolysis: All disaccharides are hydrolysed by dilute mineral acid into the constituent monosaccharides.
Maltose gives glucose only, lactose gives glucose and galactose while sucrose gives glucose and fructose.

Since the the laevorotatory power of fructose is greater than the dextrorotatory power of glucose, the overall mixture formed is therefore laevorotatory.Hence the rotation of plane polarised light changes from positive to negative when sucrose is hydrolysed.
This is known as the inversion of (+)- sucrose.
254 (+)-Sucrose H+ or (+)-glucose + (-)-fructose invertase [α]D = +66.5O [α]D = +52.7O [α]D = -92.4O [α]D = -19.9O ii Oxidation Maltose and lactose are affected by Fehling’s solution, ammoniacal silver(I) nitrate and bromine water while sucrose is not.
This is because sucrose has no ‘free’ carbonyl group.
Bromine water oxidise maltose and lactose to maltobiotic acid and lactobiotic acid respectively.
However, when sucrose is warmed with more powerful oxidising agent like dilute trioxonitrate(V) acid, it is oxidised to ethanedioic acid(oxalic acid).
iii.
Acylation Sucrose, maltose and lactose react with ethanoic anhtdride on heating to yield an octaethanoyl derivative.
This reaction confirm the presence of eight hydroxyl groups iv.
Condensation: Maltose and lactose reacts with phenylhydrazine to form phenylhydrazone.
Sucrose does not undergo this reaction because it lack reducing power and has no carbonyl group.
v. Dehydration: All disaccharides yields sugar charcoal when heated above their melting points or when they are warmed with concentrated tetraoxosulphate(VI) acid.

6 10 5 , They contain a large number of monosaccharide units linked together in the same way as disaccharides by means of a common linking oxygen atom.
Generally polysaccharides are tasteless and amorphous compounds.
They are generally insoluble in water and organic solvents.
Many of them form colloidal solution.
When they are hydrolysed with dilute acids or enzymes they yield monosaccharides.
Common examples of polysaccharides are starch and cellulose.
Inulin and glycogen are also known polysaccharides.
3.5.1 Starch Starch is a polyglucose found in potatoes, wheat, maize, rice, barley and generally in green plants.
In nature it is transformed into complex polysaccharides like gums and cellulose.It can also be transformed into simpler mono- and disaccharides by enzymic actions.
255 The exact chemical nature of starch varies from source to source.
Starch obtained from the same ssource has been found to consist of two fractions: amylase and amylopectin.
Amylose is a linear polymer containing α-D-glucopyranose units joined by 1,4-α-glycosidic linkages while amylopectin is a highly branched polymer.
The branches of amylopectin consist of 20 to 25 glucose units joined by 1,4-α- linkages and joined to each other by 1,6-α- glycosidic linkages.
