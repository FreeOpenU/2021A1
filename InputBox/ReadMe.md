The input box should work at:
http://66.76.242.197/2021A1x/InputBox/index_server.html
(Change the folder name '2021A1x' if more updates are made to the server)

- No data will be submited to the server unless the NLP result is checked before hand.
- On the current form, only the dependency part of the result is shown to the user. However, the entire result will be stored in the database.
